### Week in Review
This week was good for me. Even if the 'statistics' don't show it. I didn't complete the tasks I wanted to... but there was a reason. I had a tremendous amount of work at work. I focused on this and delivered working solution (which I'm proud of). The mini live demo will be on Monday so I'll be judged by others, not just by myself 😁
