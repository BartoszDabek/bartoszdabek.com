### Week in Review
Everything this week is done! 😊 I haven't completed all the planned tasks for a long time, so it's great! This week I had some serious thoughts about my life ... Is it worth doing what I do? Studies + work = no time for other activities or maybe not enough time 😥 (usually wasted on youtube 🤫). What can I change? How can I improve? How can I be more motivated? So many questions and no answers (so far). In order not to end this review in a bad mood - I think this week was great if we look at what has been achieved and how the work is going 😉
