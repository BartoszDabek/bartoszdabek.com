### Week in Review
Another awesome week. I accompolished everything that I planned. With God's help I finished 1st semester of my masters degree. I ran 5km under 22 minutes - which by the way is awesome result. I went for a wedding and celebrated with friends their day. This week was really productive and good. Thanks God for weeks like this! :)
