### Week in Review
It was a good week 👍. I noticed that this is how most of my weekly summaries start but what should I do if these weeks are actually good 😋. I started the week well because I started with a bike ride with my friend, then I focused more on work and achieving my goals for the week but by the way not forgetting about sport and God 👊.As you can see, I'm still reading the Springs documentation but I'm getting closer to the finish line of this chapter 😅! On Saturday, at a youth meeting in a neighboring church, I was able to share my life's testimony and I also thank God for giving me the courage to do so. One more important thing - I had an honest conversation with a friend of mine, the words he said to me a week before and now in one conversation we explained everything 💪.
