### Week in Review
It was a good week! I made the whole list and this is something I'm proud of :). I've had a lot of work this week, but somehow (thank God) it's fine with all this. I must slowly start thinking about my engineering work and whether or not I should study further at the technical university  after receiving the degree of engineer.
