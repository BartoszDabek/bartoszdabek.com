### Week in Review
👋Week #47 this year. I have achieved everything I planned - quite good 😊. This week I experienced the feeling of being a teacher - I taught students of the Technical University about object-oriented design patterns 👨‍🎓. I think this week was productive and I feel good about all my accomplishments. I have one thought I would like to write. Next year I want to have a community that will read & be involved in the whole process I do (weekly reviews, daily entries). This is one of my ideas to be implemented in 2020 👍😊.
