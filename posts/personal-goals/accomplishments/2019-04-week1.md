### Week in Review
In this week I gave myself a lot of task to do. I've done most of them and I'm happy of the progress in general. However some of them are not done. This is due to the large amount of tasks at work. It was a difficult week when it comes to work... Anyway, very soon we'll have holidays, so it'll be a time when I can rest :). This week also I had another job interview (technical conversation). I don't know the result yet, anyway I'm happy because I've achieved another goal for 2019! 👍👍
