### Week in Review
👋 It was a very quiet week. I had a lot of free time. This week I visited a friend of mine, who cut my hair and we ran together 4.5 km 🏃🏃. I wrote a post on the blog about the types of articles and from now on I will implement it ✍️. The whole checklist is done 🔥🔥. Now I'm thinking about the HackerRank 👨 challenge - when to start it.
