### Week in Review
This week was super productive. I could focus more on my 'private' stuff to learn (e.g. Docker), because I had more free time at job. I'm super happy I accomplished almost the whole list from this week. I'm also excited that the spring is officially 'started' in Poland. The weather outside is getting better and better! I love the nature and I love to watch how all of this is changing.
