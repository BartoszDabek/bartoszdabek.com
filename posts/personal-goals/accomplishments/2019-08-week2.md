### Week in Review
It was a nice week. It started with big question marks - I flew to Germany, I rented a car for the first time, I drove alone in a foreign country not my car. Thank God that he blessed me and gave me his safety. In Germany we had a lot of work (really a lot). We worked 9-10 hours a day to make our system work efficiently 😎. There are still a few bugs and I know that the next week will be difficult. But who cares now ... We have a weekend, the weather is beautiful in Poland and let's enjoy it. 👍👊💪
