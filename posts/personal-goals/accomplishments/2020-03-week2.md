### Week in Review
It was another good week. The weather at the beginning of the week was so good that we even went out with our cousin on a bike 🚴. Generally it's standard - I had a lot of work to do, there's a lot to do as part of my thesis - so I don't have too much time but thank God it's still moving forward 😊. I can be in Silesia for the weekend, which I also think is no accident 👍.
