### Week in Review
Thank God for another good week in my life 🙏! There was nothing special going on. I'm just moving towards bigger goals in small steps. At the end of this week I bought myself a new phone, which took up a large part of my life on Friday. As it turned out the phone (or its software) has a flaw and can reset itself randomly 🥺. Additionally, on Friday, I also did a full day post - thank God for giving me the strength to withstand 😇.
