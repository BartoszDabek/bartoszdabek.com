### Week in Review
That was a good week. I feel like it was more chill than the previous 🤗. I didn't accomplished things related to Kafka and the blog. It was because of the wedding I was involved in. Priorities 🙂. It's Sunday 7:14 in the morning and I'm in a hurry, so that's all for this week! See you in next one!
