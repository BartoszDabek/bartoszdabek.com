### Week in Review
This week I managed to finish my education and got a master's degree 🤗🍾! This is a reason to be proud because I remember that when I started my IT studies, I said that completing them would mean that God helped me - and that was 🙂. As far as this week is concerned, it started to be very hard - I had a rash caused probably by subconscious stress. In addition, I was a little bit upset because of a girl I like a lot. The end of the week was getting better and better. Now I feel like I'm born wanting to do new things - and that's good because now that I've graduated I want to do something new! I also plan to reorganize my room this week and buy a new desk 👍😏.
