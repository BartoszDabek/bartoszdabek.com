### Week in Review
Another week's summary and once again I have to write that it was a good week 👍. The weather is already changing slowly to autumn but this is also a beautiful time 😉. This week I managed to close all the planned topics and even made a plan beyond that. The most important thing this week is that I could go on a bike with my childhood friend and tell him a little bit about God - who knows what kind of results it will bring in the future 😏. I am also very happy with the fact that I have put my work aside for further priority. I still like what I do (maybe I love it too) but I notice that life is not about work 🙂. It seems obvious but it took me a long time to get to 😆.
