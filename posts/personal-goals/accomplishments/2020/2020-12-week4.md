### Week in Review
Today I write later than always. It is almost 4 p.m. and this is not without reason. It was the hardest week this year for me... I don't want to return with my memories to the individual days, because I'm afraid not to be spread out and disappointed in myself. I'm fine now and even though I have a pain in my heart that something has ended, I have a positive feeling for the future.
