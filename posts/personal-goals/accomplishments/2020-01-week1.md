### Week in Review
First review in 2020. I'm sitting down now and looking at the window. It's slowly getting more and more visible outside, although it's still dark. Snow has fallen and that makes me very happy ❄️❄️ (although I am aware that it will melt during the day). As you can see, this week I did everything I planned and even did a little more than that 🔥🔥! I'm happy about it, but as I'm writing this, I feel like I'm still missing something. I don't know what it is...🤔
