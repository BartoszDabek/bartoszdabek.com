### Week in Review
It was an interesting week when a lot happened. At the beginning of the week I was in Białystok - I had to pass exams at the university and thank God everything worked out 🙂! On Tuesday I came home and unfortunately I had a lot of work here 👨. I was quite often at the pool this week - I just keep going there to relax instead of swimming 🤫. By the way, everything is fine - Saturday was a great day where I was really motivated and willing to act. But now that I'm writing this (Sunday morning) it's a bit worse and something distracts me a lot 🤔. Well, it's hard... I hope I'll be in a good mood any minute...😊
