### Week in Review
üñê Another great week üí™! This week I finished my first 25-day challenge - breath holding. My current best result is about 3:35 and I won't stop until I reach my goal of 3:45 üëäüëä. Recently [MiroBurn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwmFNbGnBeEy9nTt42F4WHw) published some of its courses for free -> you can find them [here](https://akademia.pl/akademia-fundamenty/). This is great! A lot of knowledge for free! I watch this and take notes because the course is limited in time and you don't know when it will disappear ‚òπÔ∏è.
