### Week in Review
Time for a week's review 🧐. Again, I wasn't able to read the whole tutorial from Spring about the core and write a subsection of my thesis. I 'touched' both things this week, but as you can see I didn't give them enough time. As for other things this week I spent it very actively - I cycled a lot 🚴🚴. Besides, the weather was so beautiful all week long that it was indescribable - I took full advantage of it and I also tanned a lot 😋. In the next week I will focus mainly on my thesis and my plan is to close it in 2 weeks! This is my goal for now! 💪💪
