### Week in Review
It was a great week! Weather outside is stunning 😁! It's finally almost the end of the semester so I'll have more time for my stuff - refactor 4Rescue App and publish to google play or create tutorial on youtube. It's gonna be either of this one that I have to focus on during summer. I love this time in Poland. It's super hot in the day and wonderful nights with 20 degrees outside!!! Everything is green, people are happy. I'm so much thankful to God for all of this!
