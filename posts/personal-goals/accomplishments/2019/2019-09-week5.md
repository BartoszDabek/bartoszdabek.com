### Week in Review
It was another good week ❤️💚💜. I think I balance very well between work and personal life. I don't know why but I want to write that I like cooking 🍎🥦🥪. Strange, huh? 😅😅 I've done all the tasks I wanted to perform again 👍. I had several activities during the week (running + cycling + swimming pool). The only thing I need to improve is to spend more time with people & friends (altough this week I actually did that 😃).
