### Week in Review
This week was tough. First I had to move from my rented flat. Then I got sick (and still I'm sick). But overall it was a good week. I learned a lot, I met with friends and the weather outside is starting to be really nice :). I know my technical debt and what I need to focus on. If I want better job or better projects I have to invest time now and I truly belive it'll get the results in the future.
