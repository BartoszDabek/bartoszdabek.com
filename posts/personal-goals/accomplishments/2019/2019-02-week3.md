### Week in Review
This week was good for me. I beat my record in breath holding and at the same time accomplished one of my goals for 2019. In this week also I got in on studies for master's degree. Additionally, I spent some quality time with friends and family. I accomplished all of my weekly goals and also had time for watch something 'stupid' on yt or twitch. It was a good rest week ;)
