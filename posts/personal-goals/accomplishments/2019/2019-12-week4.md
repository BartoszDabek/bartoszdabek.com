### Week in Review
I have an idea 💡. How about I won't stop writing here (I truly like it) and I'll only partly move on blog site where I'll focus myself on Polish community, huh 🤔? I think that sounds fair... Well, that was only an idea I wanted to write somewhere but let's back to the review. I changed my plans about hexo page and stuff. I decided that I'll go into wordpress site - as this is more popular and I can find more easily some plugins I'll need. In addition I have some experience in wordpress - I had blog a few years ago 🤫.
