### Week in Review
This week was a good week. I got bachelor's degree. I ate a burger. I didn't use an electronic kitchen scale to see what's food weight (because I don't have any weight atm.). It was pretty good but also quite difficult to be honest. By Thursday I was constantly learning. Now I can 'breathe' but I've already registered for a master's degree, so I need to enjoy this moments of freedom. :D
