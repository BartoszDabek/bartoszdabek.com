### Week in Review
Another good week in my life :). I'm really thankfull to God for everything I have. Starting from simple things like parents and house and finishing on friends, job. In this week I didn't finish some tasks - especially projects task, but this is OK. In this week I have to finish it and be focused 100% on math. I have an exam in last week of June and I want to be prepared for that!
