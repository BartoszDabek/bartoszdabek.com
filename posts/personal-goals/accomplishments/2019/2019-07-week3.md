### Week in Review
It was a great week. The weather was finally cooperating (especially at the end of the week) and I could enjoy my vacations. I did a lot of useful and productive things (and ofc. a lot of unuseful ðŸ˜…). I had also a lot of time to think about life, goals, dreams... I really want more weeks like that ðŸ˜‰.
