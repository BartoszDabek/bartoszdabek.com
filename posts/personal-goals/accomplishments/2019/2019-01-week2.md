### Week in Review
This week was super tough. At work I could breathe, but all the stuff related to studies were overwhelming me. The positive thing is that I were keep tracking everything so I'm on a good way to achieve it all successfully (if God allows me). One more thing I have to mention is that this week I beat my personal record in breath-holding - 3:10 minutes. Really awesome!
