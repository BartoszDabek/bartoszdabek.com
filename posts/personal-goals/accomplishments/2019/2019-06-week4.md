### Week in Review
In general it was another good week in my life. The weather outside was beautiful whole week and it's so hot in there. At work everything is going great. On 2nd week of July I'm going on 2 weeks vacations!! The only thing that left is to pass the math exam. And that takes huge amount of my time.. To be honest it takes all my free time. But yeee.. I want to be prepared so... work hard now, reap the benefits later :).
