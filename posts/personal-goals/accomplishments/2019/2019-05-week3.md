### Week in Review
This week was good. Finally I accomplished the whole to-do list I planned a week ago. Maybe that means I didn't put enough in there? Ha! I don't think so :). Did anyhing extraordinary happened this week? Noo... I finished next TV series - Silicon Valley - and at this moment I don't have anything interesting to watch and learn from (learn English ofc.). Maybe I'll watch 'Friends' once again? ðŸ˜…
