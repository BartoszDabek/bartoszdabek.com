### Week in Review
What can I tell about this week? As you can see I didn't accomplish things that are mostly realted with studies... I don't have that much motivation to do it + lack of time (but it's not the main reason - I see that I waste a lot of time on some meaningless stuff). Maybe I should start with some other technique, like for example 1 study goal for 1 week 🤔. Besides, this week I had trainings, I've been at the conference and our local java group meeting called jSession. All that took a lot time from my life and hopefully next week will be more calm 😊.
