### Week in Review
I didn't have a lot of tasks on my to do list, however I didn't complete it. To be honest, I have a lot of work in my job + studies. It's kind of overwhelming. Now, we'll have almost 2 weeks break from school so I hope I'll get motivated and do all necessary job. Beside of that this week was fine - overall I ran 14km, I went to the pool a few times, had a lot of fun with my nephew :)
