### Week in Review
This week was fine. I had a lot of free time and I used it to learn something new. And I'm grateful for that to God. I've been playing in volleyball twice. Twice I was really terrible but ... I don't worry about it, I'm just doing it as a hobby :D. I've also been at the gym first time with bigger intentions. So, to conclude this week in few words - it was active.
