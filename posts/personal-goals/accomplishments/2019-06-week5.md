### Week in Review
Amazing week - isn't it? I accomplished all my assumptions/goals for this week. So far so good... This week I got new laptop from my work and a laptop is a beast! The only thing that worries me yet (but it will be announced tomorrow) is math exam result... I really hope for a positive degree. Even if I don't get it..Well I think it's not the worst thing in the world that could happen ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. To sum up this whole week in very few words - a bit crazy but good ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
