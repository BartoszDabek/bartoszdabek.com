# Summary of 2018
2018 was really good for me. I've achieved things that I didn't expect. I've read a lot, learned new skills and to be honest I've also experienced some failures.  

(btw. this summary is for me. When I'll feel bad I'll be able to open and read it :D)

### Achievements
2018 started with something brand new for me. I got hired in IT company as a programmer in February. A month later I moved out from my parents house and started to rent a flat. In April I started my first commercial project, after 2 months of very intensive trainings. In the same month, I was also on my first delegation in Germany. From May to August I was very active. I was running and cycling a lot (758.72km, over 36 hours spent on trainings measured in endomondo). In July I started writing my daily short notes and this whole 'personal-goals' project. In August I beat my personal record in running for a distance of 5km run - 22:39. October 2018 - For the first time I was alone on delegation (without a team from Poland). Finally December - I swam 50 meters underwater!

Now, when I read my achievements I can say: 'Not many things happened this year in my life', but as I mentioned at the beginning it was a good year and I don't regret it. I probably didn't put a few things I forgot about (maybe it wasn't that important :D). I hope that in the next year achievement list  will be longer ;).


### Failures
It's difficult to write about failures because our human nature is not used to talk about it. But if I have to mention something then on my list for sure is that I neglected relationships with friends (especially in the end of the year). I think I was focused too much on work, sport and - as some of my friends have told me (but I don't quite agree with it) - money. Another failure results more from my nature. I really like to talk a lot (when I feel comfortable) and I like to be involved. This is a good but not always. Especially if I know I'm very busy. I got involved in an internal project in our company and because I didn't have time, the result was I did nothing in this project. I just gave hope but that's all.

Failures are for some reason. We can ignore them or we can learn from them - it's our decission. I'm writing this summary on January 1st and I know I haven't started this year well when it comes to establishing relationships with friends. I still have 365 days, but the longer I put it off, the more stupid I am. Sad bad true.

### 2018 Goals Summary
In 2018 I established myself 6 goals to achieve. I've achieved half of them and I think this is resonable because I set this goals in July (in my opinion I should only choose 3 main goals if it was in the middle of the year). Design patterns and data structures are really important and as I realized I can't do it, I just decided not to touch them and move it to the next year. Regarding to the presentation - I created one but I didn't publish it and I think I never will. This is one of the goals that doesn't make sense to me right now, so I think I made the wrong decision when creating this point.
