### Week in Review
It was another nice week. I had some serious work to do at the very beginning after go-live so I was quite busy but thanks God he gave me the wisdom to solve all problems 🙏. This week was crazy if we talk about spending time with friends... Almost every evening we met with friends / family. That's cool 👊! I really love and like such evenings - spending time together is more valuable than doing it yourself ☺️.
