### Week in Review
This week was ok. Nothing exciting but I know that I used that time wisely (I certainly didn't waste it for watching netflix or something similar). I was at my parents' house during the whole week. I love to be here. I coocked a lot (I love it), I went to the  swimming pool every day and I enjoyed all the little things I didn't mention here. :)
