### Week in Review
This week was good, especially at the end of the week !! I love the time of early autumn, when it is not too cold outside, but also not too hot so that I can sit with hot tea and warm everything in me: D. I know I sound like a 60-year-old grandpa, but I really enjoy it! :). In this week I didn't do anything with car crash app, but that was because I didn't have too much time during this week... Not always everything is perfect :)
