### Week in Review
Yayy. This week was intense and I know that the next (apart from Christmas) will also be. I need to write an engineering work by the end of the year, so I focus on this. All items from the list are done - this means that it was a well-organized list: D. I will give myself fewer tasks for the next week (due to engineering work).
