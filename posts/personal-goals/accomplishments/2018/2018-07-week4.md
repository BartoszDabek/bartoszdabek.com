### Week in Review
This weekend was good. I had many activities such as running or cycling. I also did some job with 'car crash app' which is good for me because I'm starting to see the point where is that going. I'm also happy because I made some 'online' shopping and for now I'm telling you what - I don't buy t-shirts for at least 2 years bcause I have a lot of them now! Downsides of this weekend? Hmm... I think I didn't focus enough on new technical things, like learn some programming language etc. Need to work on it
