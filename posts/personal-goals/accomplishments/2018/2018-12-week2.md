### Week in Review
This week was fine. I felt so much better than week ago and two weeks ago. I had a lot of tasks in work which I closed so it's good. I have feeling that I miss something... something is not done but I have no idea what is that feeling about. Anyway as always I'm hoping for better tomorrow even if today is awesome :).
