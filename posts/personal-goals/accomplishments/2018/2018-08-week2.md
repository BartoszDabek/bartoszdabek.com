### Week in Review
This week was good, maybe not the best in the work because I'm still struggling with one task but besides that it was good. I had a lot of activities, I'm doing well with my daily habits ðŸ’ª, I had a funny story about earphones and rubber that left in my ear ðŸ˜‚. It is good! I can also see improvment in my English, in both speaking and writing but I know that I still need to learn a lot of vocabulary to master it and I know that I'll achieve it! :)
