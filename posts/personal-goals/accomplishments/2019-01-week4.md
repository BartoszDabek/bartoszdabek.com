### Week in Review
This week was fine. I finished the work related to the diploma thesis, I got a new project at work (I'll see in the next 2-3 weeks if it was a good choice) and finally I graduated!! The last one is the best. I mean.. I'll miss people but the time I'll finally have. I'll be able to focus on things I want to learn.
