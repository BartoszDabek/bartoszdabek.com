### Week in Review
The whole week was good 👍. The weather was beautiful and sunny 😍😎! The most important event of this week was my meeting with a friend and that we could talk frankly. Besides, on Friday I was at a bachelor party and I discovered that go-karts is great fun 👊. On Friday I also cycled a long distance - 80km - which I am happy with 🙂. I noticed (actually a long time ago) that it's nice to work 4 days instead of 5. This is something to think about...🤫
