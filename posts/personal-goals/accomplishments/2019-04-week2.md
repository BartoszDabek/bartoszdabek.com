### Week in Review
This week was good. At work I have very exciting task which motivated me to work even harder! I got feedback from my last job interview and I know what are my weaknesses and on what I should focus - this is also good point. Yeahh... I'm still quite busy with job + studies but to be honest - I like it. I don't like to waste time. Sometimes I need rest but I know, this is not the right time for it. For now: focus, motivation and action!
