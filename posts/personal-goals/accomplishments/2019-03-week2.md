### Week in Review
Uhuuu! I haven't finished many things this week! Anyway, this week was great and I have a justification for this uncompleted list. All this is related to the job interview and my preperations for this. It appeared dynamically and it wasn't something I expected. Besides everything is fine! I finished hold breath challenge this week with a stunning result - 3:32!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
