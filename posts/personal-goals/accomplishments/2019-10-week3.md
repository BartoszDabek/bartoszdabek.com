### Week in Review
It was a good week 👌🖐. I had some spare time for my own things for example: I visited my friends. The only thing that makes me feel bad about this week is that I still didn't finish lecture about builder design pattern. I made some progress on that but it's not finished yet 😓. In this week it have to be my main goal, because in 2 weeks I have lecture at the University 👨‍🎓.
