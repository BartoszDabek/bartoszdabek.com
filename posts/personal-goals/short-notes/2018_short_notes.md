Today I had a nail surgery. It hurt for a moment but now it's better... Now I have one week to recover myself because of sickness leave. 

10/07/2018
---
Definitely not a productive day... I woke up few minutes before 8 A.M and didn't have energy to do something creative. I think the reason is I don't want to do anything with my [Car crash app](https://github.com/bartoszdabek/4rescue) at this moment and my mind telling me to focus on it. Tomorrow I won't even think of it and will see the results. 

11/07/2018
---
Once again.. I had my alarm setted up at 4:50 A.M but got up at 7:30. But the day was not at all tragic. I did 20 kilometers on a bike and other things I planned. I guess significant was that yesterday I did a list of things I want to do today. Tomorrow I'm going on lake to take some rest of the life <3. 

15/07/2018
---
After few days of rest on the lake it's time to back to say something. I did myself a little break of Internet, daily work and all of my planned habits. I think I reset my head good enough to be productive in this weekend (I hope so). 💪💪💪

16/07/2018

This day was good! I got up before 5 A.M, drank glass of water, prepared a really good breakfast and went to work! Excellent! After work did training and was learning English. I think I need to focus more on my engineer work and car crash app but still I don't feel it. Need to motivate myself to start it.. don't know how yet 😒

17/07/2018

Today I planned everything - every minute and I did all the things that was on my todo list. Additionally I did some extra - which I hadn't planned before. I started to learn to use git-svn which is actually pretty nice and in a very few days I'm planning to start using git-svn instead of the svn client. The important thing is that I got approval on my vacation in last two weeks of August... Now I have to figure out what I want to do at this time, in addition to rest 😀😀

Hi! I finished my work earlier today than usual, but ... (there is always but) just because I was waiting for an e-mail from coworkers to clarify something. After receiving the email I had to work 1 hour at home which I expected. Actually this day wasn't really exciting, just a normal day. Ohh one thing that dawned on me. My roommates found my 'daily to-do schedule' and asked me a lot of 'why'. 😫


19/07/2018
---
Woo hoo! What a day! I got up at 4:30 A.M and then I went running! Yes! Maybe the run wasn't that long (it lasted about 15 minutes) but still it is before 5 A.M !! I'm happy and I'm really proud of it so I have to say this to myself 'Good Job!'. Yeey ...


20/07/2018
---
I'm thinking about changing the content of this daily-notes and what do I mean by changing the content? Well.. all my days are quite similar to others and my life isn't so exciting that I can write fabulous stories here. So maybe I should start writing about the happy things that happened or the happy thoughts I have. I don't know... Actually it's my content and I do what I want here. That's why I want to say that I'm grateful to God for my life, family, job and the wisdom He gave me and many other things that are too much personal to write them here. 🤗

Today I ran 5 km at 5:30 A.M and then at 6 P.M cycled 16 km. Overall it was a good day for me, I started writing my car crash app and finally I see some progress on that. Also while running and cycling I can see that many valuable ideas comming to my mind, I need to find a way to note them.✍️

22/07/2018
---
Excellent morning, decent afternoon and evening = good day overall :). Today was a chillout day, I watched the F1 race and some athletic competitions. In addition I also did training and I coocked a tasty dinner :). Let's start new weekend!

23/07/2018
---
No fireworks today, just a normal day. Did my job, training and so on ... I have new task in job which is quite interesting and I'm struggling with TDD approach. I know it's good but my experience is not quite good, maybe I should buy some book about tests and TDD.

24/07/2018
---
I ordered new shoes today, actually 2 pairs (in different colors), I hope they will match on my feet. Also I created a new branch on github in car crash app - branch for testing g-forces, and had a little fun with rebasing. And I finally know what is the difference between merge and rebase. 💪

25/07/2018
---
Today at 4:45 A.M I ran 2 km and started the day very actively. Actually I like mornings like this. I also installed the 'Lifelog' app on my phone to count steps I take (I have old phone which doesn't have build in step counter). 

26/07/2018
---
Another good one day. Today I realized that I love to get up early. I can do some of my 'daily routine' stuff done even before some ppl awake. It's nice! And it's something what motivates me.💪

27/07/2018
---
Hello friday :)! It was a looong day, at the end of the day I was REALLY tired and I fell asleep so fast. I bought some clothes and shoes in tuesday/wednesday and today I were measuring them. Unfortunetally shoes doesn't really fit and I'm afraid I have to return them. Which is bad because I really like their style and what is more bad that it isn't that easy to buy nice shoes on my feet which is big enough (30,5 cm).

28/07/2018

Arghhh.. I wished for good weather today, but the weather definietly didn't coopeate. It was really hot but so cloudy. Lately I can see that I have no enough time! Ofc I spend some time on yt and distractions like this which actually wasting my time but this is also needed to give myself a little entertainment. Also I talked with my friend today about investing money instead of freezing them we'll see what comes out of it.

29/07/2018
---
Sooo hot Sunday we had in here! It was 30 degrees and no lake! :( As always in Sunday I gave myself a little break from 'productive' style of life. The good news is that my good friend came from Belgium and will stay one week so I'm thinking of taking remote work instead of sitting in the office so we can hang out.😎

30/07/2018
---
Today we had webex meeting with our team, talking about the project we are on, current status and so on. I need to focus on my task now because in thursday I have a short presentation of what is done and howdoes it works. Also I started watching [JS videos by Java Brains](https://javabrains.io/courses/corejs_jsfordev/) which I think is really great. 

31/07/2018
---
Last day of July. Time really flies by. Today I decided that I want to measure my expenses and incomes so I'll know how much can I safe monthly. I'm starting with first of August. I downloaded the app 'Money Manager' which gonna help me in it. 

01/08/2018
---
Today I had great evening. I met with friends and we were talking in public park until late hours that means I hadn't long sleep but it was worth it!

02/08/2018
---
I slept today 4,30h but after morning cofee (really morning :D) it was OK. I had a little presentation today about my task in job, all went well, I got some feedback about it and it's good! Also once again we had a great evening with our friends. Life is good! :)

03/08/2018
---
Once again - 5h of sleep. It's ok when I'm waking up but I think I need one night without alarm... so I can charge my physical batteries. It's really hot summer and every evening I'm hanging out with my friends so it's hard to do something more (meaning learn something) but I really enjoy this (whos not :D).

04/08/2018
---
Today we had baptism in our church. At the evening I spent good time with friends, just talking :).

05/08/2018
---
Great Sunday, I was completely off the computer, I only committed weekly review in the morning. Next week gonna be more effective, because I'm going back to the city where I work.

06/08/2018
---
Wow! That was definietly the worst Monday since I work in my company. And I don't mean like something bad happend, but my productivity and fatigue. I almost slept on my desk.. It's note for me: next time just go home, sleep few hours and then start work because yesterday ... really I did nothing value.

07/08/2018
---
Pretty good day. I think I should call it decent. Nothing special happened or anything bad. At the weekend we have plans with friends to go to the lake but I will decide on Thursday whether to go or not. If the weather will cooperate then I'm on board.

08/08/2018
---
Not a lot to talk about. I watched a lot of videos about JS on youtube and some others stuff (which killed my time). I have also found a 'shops' where I can design my own T-shirts which I actually planning to release in June 2019. 

09/08/2018
---
What a morning! :D I woke up and went running, while running I listened to music with earphones on and suddenly one of my earphones came out BUT the rubber was left in my ear. I tried to pull it out but only pushed it deeper. So I had to go to the hospital to take it out. At the moment it's a really funny story, but when I had this rubber in my ear, believe me it wasn't :D.

10/08/2018
---
Almost 8 hours of sleep today because I didn't wake up when alarm ringed. It's good, I mean sometimes we need more sleep. Today I struggled with a task I have in job. Task looks easy but if we go into details it isn't. 

11/08/2018
---
Another good Saturday :) I was running, cycling, writing something in a car crash app, I did a workout. Really one thing I regret is that I didn't meet with my friends but .. yeah I had a lot of this last week so I can call it even.

12/08/2018
---
Today I made up for my arrears yesterday and met with friends on the grill. We spent quality time talking and so on :D. Firstly I planned to go back to the city I work but after some time I decided to stay in home town and drive tomorrow. That was a good decision :).

13/08/2018
---
Whole day at work I was struggling with the task from Friday ... and still it isn't finished. Hope tomorrow I'll finish that because sometimes even after work I'm thinking of how to resolve it (SOMETIMES! :D).

14/08/2018
---
Finally moved on with the task! And I did back to my hometown. Yeeey! Today the weather wasn't so good but good enough to go for a bike :D. Now I need diet plan because I want to build more muscle mass, but I think I'll start doing it in September.

15/08/2018
---
Today is a national holiday and it's a day off at work. I spent the morning and early afternoon on my own tasks (cleaning :D etc.) and later, I met with my friends at homemade pizza and something sweet :D. 

16/08/2018
---
It's been a month since I write here regulary, nice! And you know if anyone ever reads it (even me in the future) it's worth doing. I spend 2-5 minutes on it (it depends on the day) but in my head it's a feeling: 'Look, you have done something today!' and it's good! 

17/08/2018
---
Arghhhh.. Terrible day, one of my friends with whom we planned to go on a trip, he said he can't do it. When he said that, it ruined my day because all my thoughts were: 'Why now? When we have to leave in 5 days, and most things are already planned"...

18/08/2018
---
Today I finished my work finally and I'm free, I mean I can truly relax during my holidays. I hope I'll, especially my brain from all these mundane, work related task. 

19/08/2018
---
The most anti social Sunday I had until few months. I didn't meet up with any of my friends/colleagues, well in fact I did because I was in a church at the morning. Instead of that I was watching a lot of YT (not for fun only), and did some work on my personal projects.

20/08/2018
---
Today I focused on car crash app project. I spent 5 hours on fixing unit tests (by fixing I mean make them run), it was terrible! I wrote 3 classes, one test class and then I was trying to run that test. Finally I did, but man... a lot of effort and still I don't have an idea why it's works! :D. Well, tomorrow fight part.2 💪

21/08/2018
---
Haha! Today I had a lot of laugh :D. I realized why yesterday tests didn't work. It was because I placed them in wrong folders :D. Funny that I lost so many hours and really didn't focus on that thing! But.. what is moreover interesting is that, actually I made them work in wrong folders! It's odd that it really worked in there.

22/08/2018
---
I can tell - it was a good Wednesday. Today we planned to go on our trip, but plan changed and we leave tomorrow morning (REALLY MORNING at 3 AM :D). I did everything I planned for this week so I'm happy. I also hope that this trip won't break my 'good habits' and we'll have a good time.

23/08/2018
---
Ohh! What a day! :D. 4 hours before the trip, our friend's mum called and cancelled his trip (because he's too young) so only me and one of my friends drove. But it worked. We did it and I can say that I'm happy and I don't regret that I'm here (right now we're at a friend's house in some small village), it's beautifull, it's relaxing... It's vacation! :)

24/08/2018
---
Ok.. Today really fast note :D. We had a great time with friends on our trip and I really enjoy this time :) !!

25/08/2018
---
We have been at aquapark today and then later on grill at my family. As always - gooooood time.. and good food :).

26/08/2018
---
I did back to home after few days of chillout and many kilometers traveled. I'm 2 kg heavier, so I need a little reduction. But today I also have a grill, we celebrate cousin's birthday so the reduction starts from tomorrow. 

27/08/2018
---
It's so hard to get back to wake up at 5 A.M. It's kind of normal because I was tired after whole this trip etc. but I need to tell my subconscious that I can do it, especially that I did it before. Today we had a small meeting/party with a couple of friends. We were just talking and having fun altogether.

28/08/2018
---
Today I made a big improvement with my car crash app. What I planned for this week (regarding to app) - is done. But if I can do more... why don't do it? 💪💪

29/08/2018
---
Today I woke up at 6:20 in the morning, drank coffee, went to run and started work (by work I mean my own project). In the afternoon I went cycling with my cousin, we talked and generally spent time actively. That was a good day! 

30/08/2018
---
Lately, I start to think that all this writing doesn't make sense because I don't have the exciting life I can write about everyday. But when I start thinking this way, second thoughts come up - `so, why did u start?`. And the answer is - feeling when you finish writing and you know you did something during the day already. This is one of the reasons why I won't stop writing in the morning! 

31/08/2018
---
Phew! Today, when I was doing something on the computer, the SSD disk suddenly disconnected without any warning. Fortunately, everything works fine for me after turning the computer off and on! I almost had a heart attack as I thought how much data I could lose!

01/09/2018
---
Another month started! Time flies by so fast ... Today I cycled and after that, I went to my friends and we have been talking in general.

02/09/2018
---
Today I've been on grill at my friends. It was good time, a lot of laughs, quality talks and of course - good food! :). Then in the evening I drove to the city where I work so I can prepare myself to back to the job. Tomorrow I'm going to Germany, to client that we are working for.

03/09/2018
---
New week started. Today, the whole day I travelled to Stuttgart. First I drove by train to capital of Poland (Warsaw :D). I arrived to Warsaw at around 1 PM, even a little bit earlier. Plain to Stuttgart was at 5 PM... so had to wait a lot. Actually I'm not alone here. I went with my friend from project (and from office). He's more experieced in the whole travelling etc. so it is good to have someone like this around you. Finally we arrived to Stuttgart at 7:30 PM. And then we rented a car and drove another 70 km to our destination. 

04/09/2018
---
Today we had a lot of work... Started at 8:30 AM and finished at 6 PM and tomorrow I think it might be similarly. But after work we went to restaurant and had a pleasent evening. I ordered cheesburger which was so DELICIOUS! I also wasn't aware of power of chilli pepper and ate it. After that I was sooooo regreting this :D

05/09/2018
---
Another day full of work. As yesterday - we started at 8 AM and finished at 6 PM. It was a loooong day full of pitfalls. Still we have a lot of work to do and tomorrow is production server installing. I hope that everything will go fine. After work we backed to hotel and then went for a dinner. Some Greek restaurant, really good food! :)

06/09/2018
---
Today I get a lot of tasks to do. It was like: I were sitting and buum.. new task, new task, new task. Next week will be tough, but I belive that if I plan everything correctly then it will be much more easier :). We finished work at 3 PM today so we had a time to do something (tomorrow we have flight back to Poland, so we have to back to the hotel near the airport), we went to biiiiig shopping center called `Metzinger outlet` (or something similar). I'm not big fan of shopping so there wasn't anything interesting for me. At the end of the day we went to Indian restaurant. Cool place, different than others and actually food was tasty! :)

07/09/2018
---
Time for the return trip. I woke up at 5:30 AM, read something, did workout, took a shower, packed my bags and went to breakfast at the hotel. After breakfast we went (I was with a colleague from work at the delegation) to the airport and few hours later we landed in Warsaw. And now the funny part :D. We had to use the train to get to Bialystok and it was so baad. It was like people ant hill. We didn't have a seat so we had to stand for 2.5 hours :D. But the final point is that we have arrived. At the end of the day I went to my friends on grill and as always with friends we had veeeery goood time!! :)

08/09/2018
---
Finally woke up in home town bed!! It's always good feeling :). Today I was working on a car crash app and I was thinking about job tasks, because the next week will be difficult (installation of the production server was postponed to the next week). Besides, I did all my daily habits: reading, training, English, cold shower...

09/09/2018
---
Today I've been in church and after it I went for cycle. Before I backed to Bialystok I went to my friends on little grill party (I challenged myself to keep calories and this is not helping :D). It was a good Sunday :)

10/09/2018
---
Another Monday on board! :). It was a good Monday in work, I did a really good job and I'm proud of myself 'cause of that :D. Planned well, done better!  👌👌

11/09/2018
---
Wooh! Today, I almost forgot to write something. It is now 17:44 and I realized that I did not write anything here! Fortunately, I remembered it on time! ⏱️ I now have many tasks to do at work, so let this be my excuse: D

12/09/2018
---
Day after day... everything goes so fast. As before in this week I don't have much time because of work but I hope that it will return in its own time.

13/09/2018
---
In work we slowly moving on. In the next week I'll probably have more free time and there won't be all this pressure that tasks have to be done on yesterday (actually atm it's not pressure like this :D). Today I also found out that on next delegation I'm going all by myself, which is kind of exciting and making me a little afraid.

14/09/2018
---
Today I ordered the book `Effective Java (3rd Edition)` in Polish because it's cheaper and this is my native language so I'll understand 100% of the book But when I read the book in Polish, I plan to buy original version.

15/09/2018
---
WoW! It is 2 months since I write something in here! And I think it's slowly time for review and some changes because I'm finding out this daily writing is fine, but can be somehow better and have more impact in my life... Just need to figure out what exactly to change and how.... so prepare yourselfs for changes :)

16/09/2018
---
Sunday, laazy sunday ... I'm kind of regreting this weekend.. I mean, I didn't meet up with any of my friends or so.. I had 2 occassions but I rejected both. In the next weekend I need to make up for it.

17/09/2018
---
Hi Monday! As almost usual I woke up very early (5 am) and went to run. I ran 2 km, so maybe not too long distance but if I run 2 km a day then in a year I'll have 700+ km - what looks good!

18/09/2018
---
As I said before, I want to change content of this daily short-notes a little bit. Instead of writing what happend 'today' I want to write what I want to happen. To do that I need to write 2 short notes in one day... because right now I'm writing about the day before as 'today'.

19/09/2018
---
Today I read a post on medium, something about `How I landed offers from top companies...`. And I'm really motivated to work harder. I downloaded evernote, onenote, dropbox and so I'll track my progression. I'm prepared, now I have to start act! 

20/09/2018
---
I thinking about recording myself and the progress I'm making. Especially at the gym (I don't go there yet), holding my breath, swimming (I'm also not going there yet :D )... Just a short videos on youtube saved as private. I think about it...but I haven't decided yet wheter I'll do it because of lack of time.

21/09/2018
---
Today I went with my friends on a swimming pool, was fine and what is the most important I finally met with my friends! :). 😊😊

22/09/2018
---
Super day! :) First I cycled to the church 15km from my home and I was helping there with something (we were fixing something on attic). Afterwards I backed home and ate biig portion of spaghetti, which was amazingly good (made by my mom😍 ). I love days like this in early fall. 👍👍

23/09/2018
---
Another cool day.. My brother's wife had a birthday today so our entire family showed up and we celebrated :) Valuable time with family!👪

24/09/2018
---
Today I had whole day in travel. I started at 10am by coming into a train and finished at 8pm in the hotel room. I'm quite exhausted but it's okay :)

25/09/2018
---
I really need to learn more vocabulary! When people use more complicated words very often I just don't understand them and I need to get this word from the whole sentence. And when my brain is focusing on that I don't focus on the next sentence they say.

26/09/2018
---
Good Wednesday. Today most of our team moved out and I stayed only with a one of colleagues. First I was thinking we wouldn't have any topic to talk (because other nationality and age difference which is huge) but we went for a dinner and had very good time and valuable talk! 

27/09/2018
---
Last day onsite... Quite good, I've almost closed all my tasks, client is pleased and the weather in the Germany is also good! Carpe Diem!

28/09/2018
---
Travel time.. I'm starting to hate it. You have to be at the airport at 9 am and you're at home at 7 pm. A lot of waiting for the train and so on. But overall the day was fine, many pleasent people, except the noisy girls in the train ... but who cares :D

29/09/2018
---
Today I visited my private hairdresser (my friend). I also spent some time on my car crasp app, especially on location detection.

30/09/2018
---
Today I've been in church on some holiday. After service, there was a lunch, cake and coffee. Good time spent with people :)

01/10/2018
---
October - welcome onboard :). Today after work I played volleyball. I was terrible! :D But that was first training after a while, so maybe I'll get better soon (at least I hope so :D ).

02/10/2018
---
I have a multi-sport card that allows me free use of gyms, swimming pools and other sports activities. Yeey!

03/10/2018
---
Lazy Wednesday ... Today I did location permission work in my car crash app. Now I only need to clean it up, test it and location topic will be closed.

04/10/2018
---
Another day flew so fast. Today I wrote a little with my friend. She told me that I should stop living with that constant rush.. I guess I have to think about it.

05/10/2018
---
I played volleyball today. Once again I was SO TERRIBLE!! I lost something.. I can't feel a ball while spiking. I have one more training in Monday. Really hope this time I'll get better.

06/10/2018

Lovely Saturday. I've been at the gym this afternoon. In the evening I went at the swimming pool and after that to my cousins house. We had a good time!
