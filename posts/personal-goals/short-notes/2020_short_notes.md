First day of 2020 😲. I did 2 pretty important things today. First of all, I met with a friend of mine from high school and secondly I read my journal from 2019, which is quite interesting. It's interesting how my English developed throughout the year 😎.

This year begins very much like the previous one. Once again I have a lot of work and I often go to the pool.😏🏊

I got sick 🤧! I woke up at 4 am with a cold but most of the day I felt pretty decent. Unfortunately, in the evening I felt terrible again 😭

It was a very tough night 🤒. I think I was waking up like 10 times during the night 😒... Fortunately, I felt much better during the day, so I could write a review of 2019, which you can read [here](https://www.bdabek.pl/2020/01/04/podsumowanie-roku-2019/).
