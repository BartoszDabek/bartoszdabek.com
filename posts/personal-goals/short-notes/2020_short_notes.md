First day of 2020 😲. I did 2 pretty important things today. First of all, I met with a friend of mine from high school and secondly I read my journal from 2019, which is quite interesting. It's interesting how my English developed throughout the year 😎.

02/01/2020
---
This year begins very much like the previous one. Once again I have a lot of work and I often go to the pool.😏🏊 

03/01/2020
---
I got sick 🤧! I woke up at 4 am with a cold but most of the day I felt pretty decent. Unfortunately, in the evening I felt terrible again 😭

04/01/2020
---
It was a very tough night 🤒. I think I was waking up like 10 times during the night 😒... Fortunately, I felt much better during the day, so I could write a review of 2019, which you can read [here](https://www.bdabek.pl/2020/01/04/podsumowanie-roku-2019/).

05/01/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😍. In the morning I was in church and in the evening my cousin and his fiancee invited me. Of course I took the opportunity :)

06/01/2020
---
Today we had a national holiday 🇵🇱. Thanks to that I could focus on my goals for this week ❤🔥!

07/01/2020
---
First day at work after a long weekend. Today we had a sprint review and we didn't accomplish many tasks 😎. Anyway... Today I also celebrated Orthodox Christmas with my family. We went to dinner at my grandmother's where our whole family was 🤗!

08/01/2020
---
Today I had to fix a few bugs in the tasks I pushed recently. I had a deadline. I don't like working under pressure 😰 and I don't think anyone does 👊.

09/01/2020
---
I have to control my time at work!! Once again, I've worked for 12 hours or more and no one will pay me for that extra hours 😩

10/01/2020
---
Friday 😍😍! It was a very good day. With God's help, I solved all the problems at work and could start the weekend at 3 pm with a very good mood! In the evening I went to the pool with my cousins - we talked and rested 👍

11/01/2020
---
Today I was at the funeral of my distant uncle ⛪. It's good to think about death and keep that in mind in your life. We should try to live in a way that doesn't waste time and give happienes to others! 🙆🏻‍♂️

12/01/2020
---
👋Sunday. It actually was a sunny day 😄. Today, after church I talked to one of my friends, who showed me his house. I spent the rest of the day at home ;]

13/01/2020
---
The week has begun! Today I went to the Bialystok and I'll stay here until Thursday. Thanks God that I have my own apartment!! 👍

14/01/2020
---
It's been a busy but pleasant day. I had to be at the university today and by the way I passed one subject 👨‍🎓👍. I also had to work late (7-8pm) because during the day I studied instead of working 🤫

15/01/2020
---
It was a nice day. I worked in my client's office today - it's cool to be there once in a while 😉. Later I had to go to the university - I had a presentation in one subject about multithreaded programming. And at the very end of the day my friends came by (actually, a friend rents a room from me and his fiancée came by) and we had a good time 👍👊.

16/01/2020
---
Back home :). I love this place where I was born - it is quiet and peaceful. Nature is not yet so much disturbed by technological progress and the human hand. Today's entry is very 'poetic' 😅.

17/01/2020
---
Another good day 🙂. No special revelations. At work I did my job and I'm going safely to the weekend 💪. Tomorrow I'll be a wedding witness and today we had an entry attempts  - it's rather not stressful, after all it's not my wedding 😄👰🤵.

18/01/2020
---
Wedding day 💒🔔🔔! I was a witness today but thank God I wasn't stressed out :). A beautiful wedding and a good wedding! 😉

19/01/2020
---
Sunday :). Today we had dinner together with the guests and the wedding couple. It was okay 😊. I talked with many friends and I think I had a good time 👊. In the evening I went with my cousin to the pool 🏊🏊.

20/01/2020
---
It was a good Monday. I had some free time and thanks to that I could spent the evening with my friend and his fiance 👍👍.

21/01/2020
---
Another beautiful day 😊. This time I had more work than yesterday, but maybe that's a good thing, at least I didn't waste time on some stupidity. In the evening we went to a friend's for dinner. It was tasty and funny 🥘😅.

22/01/2020
---
The next day when I spent the evening at someone 😏. It's good because this year is supposed to be different from the previous one where I mainly devoted my time to study and work. This time the goal is different - to spend time with family, friends - people more or less close to me 👊.

23/01/2020
---
It's been a hard day. I was doing an urgent patch to the application + a few other things stopped working...😪😪 From the positive things I came back to my beloved Hajnówka ❤.

24/01/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗! To be honest, I was very ineffective today. I solved the problems from yesterday (some of them solved themselves, I only got the information that it's ready) and then I took care of the organizational issues (docker, git). Sometimes it takes days like this to get a buzz off 🤯.

25/01/2020
---
Interesting Saturday 🙂. I guess I didn't do much - I was preparing to pass the subject for Monday and wrote a post on my blog, and yet I feel that I was productive 🤩. And in the evening, I went to the pool with my friends and then I bumped into friends for a while. 👊

26/01/2020
---
The wonderful day☺️. I could be at the service today and have lunch with my parents later. In the evening we went to listen to carols. It was a performance organized by the neighboring church. It was a very good time. 👍👍

27/01/2020
---
Yes! I passed the exam 👊! It's Monday and I felt very unproductive at work. I worked for really long time (10-12 hours?) and I feel like I did nothing 😪. At the end of the day, I noticed something very strange under my left eye - something like a bruise. I wonder, is it caused by fatigue or rather by sitting in front of the computer too long? 

28/01/2020
---
It was a bad day. I feel like I didn't do anything at work even though I worked 8 hours 😶... I also decided to come home earlier and I did - at 7pm I was in Hajnówka and spent the evening with my friends 🙂. 

29/01/2020
---
Today was much better than yesterday 👍👍. In fact, I was working on modifying one query to the database which took me a whole 8 hours. But at least I see some progress 🙂. Today I also went for a run with my friend - we ran about 4.5 km and then we went to the pool to take a bath 😂🤣.

30/01/2020
---
Today, with friends we went to visit our mutual friends together. We made pizzas 🍕🍕 and we had a nice evening ☺️! 

31/01/2020
---
Last day of January 😲! How quickly that time went by! Tonight I went to the pool again with my cousin 🏊.

01/02/2020
---
And it's the new month 👊! It was a nice day. I spent a lot of time studying or actually reading slides from the presentation - next week I will have 2 exams 👨🎓. In the evening - as is lately often - I went with my cousin to the swimming pool 💪💪 - I'm only worried about the fact that we go there mainly to relax and do not swim much...

02/02/2020
---
I'm in pain! After yesterday's pool, my back started hurting 😫😫! We were at my uncle's for his 50th birthday today. It was fun - we could meet the whole family but the pain was sometimes unbearable 😪.

03/02/2020
---
Monday. I was at a job interview today. I found out how much I don't know and after the interview I felt very bad - mentally - something like I lost some battle 😥. Nevertheless, this will always be a good thing, because now I'll go through all these topics myself and be richer with new knowledge 🤗!

04/02/2020
---
There it is! Finally I finished updating the documentation of the installation of our environments and at the same time I cleaned up some docker containers 👍👍.

05/02/2020
---
Tonight I got an answer after Monday's job interview. I was offered a junior position. It may seem like a step backwards but I think I can learn a lot there and I have to seriously consider 🤨🤨.

06/02/2020
---
The next day is over. Today, exceptionally, I wasn't going anywhere. I spent the whole day at home in front of the computer - I am not proud of it but I do not regret 😅. Slowly I have to present my mindset for writing my thesis 👨🎓.

07/02/2020
---
What a day it was... I took up a job and couldn't let go - one thing didn't work and it didn't leave me alone 😣. At the very end of the day I solved it 👍😊! Apart from that, I wrote about this job offer a few days earlier. I decided to reject it due to the lack of possibility to work remotely in 100% - and this is my goal. 

08/02/2020
---
A lot has happened today. In the morning, my cousin and I went to the countryside and we loaded the wood for firewood and then came back with a tractor 😄🚜. Then I went running with my friend and we did 6 km 🏃 (we had a very average time). At the end of the day - to relax - I went with my cousin to the pool 🤗.

09/02/2020
---
It was a wonderful Sunday 😍😍! It was very sunny. In the morning I was in the church and in the afternoon I went to see friends. At first we went for a walk and then we ate, talked and played some board games 😉.

10/02/2020
---
Today, however, the weather was terrible - it was raining and the wind was blowing. Despite everything I went running with my friend and we did 3.8km 🏃🏃. I think that this year's goal of 100km could have been raised to 200 😀.

11/02/2020
---
Ahhhh!! Today I almost reached the 50m underwater goal 🏊. I've swam 40-45 meters and surfaced. I'm a bit angry, because I still had oxygen to do 1-2 more repss. 💪💪

12/02/2020
---
It was a good day :). Nothing unusual happened, but still I'm satisfied. I spent the whole day at home and started to get acquainted with materials for my thesis 📗👍.

13/02/2020
---
Finally, I was able to finish the task at work - or actually pass it on for review 👍. Besides, it was an ordinary day and nothing interesting was going on 🙂.

14/02/2020
---
My roommate is sick and I feel that slowly this disease is also taking me 🤧🤧. Still, it was a good day 😉. Today I ran a little over 4.5km with my friend even though I did not feel 100% healthy 👍.

15/02/2020
---
And I got sick 😰🤒. I spent the whole day reading scientific papers on the subject of my thesis... My head is steaming after that day...🤯

16/02/2020
---
Today I felt much better - actually I almost recovered 🤗. Today I was only in church and spent the rest of the day at home 🏠. In the evening my cousin came to me and together we watched over my nephew 👶👶.

17/02/2020
---
It was a nice Monday 😎! It was very, VERY warm - 12 degrees in mid-February 🤯! I'm a little glad because I like it when it's warm and on the other hand I'm afraid for what's happening to the climate this year 😶.

18/02/2020
---
The next day passed 😏. Actually, I didn't do anything very valuable today. I finished a pdf with 10 keyboard shortcuts to IntelliJ and downloaded some repositories with the code to calculate k means 👍.

19/02/2020
---
Again, I haven't moved much from home, but I feel it was a good day 👍👍. We had some meetings at work today (in the meantime I did my home training), someone even went to my website and wrote a comment [bdabek.pl](bdabek.pl) 👊.

20/02/2020
---
Today I was at the pool with my cousin 💪. I could use this relaxation because today we had a lot of work with the git and all the branching 😮.

21/02/2020
---
Another good day! :) Today I was at the pool again - this time with my two buddies. My blog [bdabek.pl](bdabek.pl) has been approved for jvm-bloggers and gained a lot of traffic thanks to this 👍👍.

22/02/2020
---
Oh, yes! This Saturday started wonderfully 😍. It was sunny in the morning 😎 so I went running with my friend (we would have gone anyway), we did 6 km and then I went to him for breakfast. I started writing my thesis (I wrote one page 😅) and in the evening I went with my cousin to the pool to relax 🤗🤗.

23/02/2020
---
It was a good day until evening. I don't want to write what happened because it's private, but let's just say I'm a little angry.

24/02/2020
---
All day long it was very hard for me to focus 😥. At 4:30 p.m. I went running with a friend of mine and it took my emotions away. 

25/02/2020
---
This afternoon I went to Bialystok 🚗. It's time to start the last semester of studies! 👨🎓

26/02/2020
---
It's been a tough day 😨. It's mostly about work... it turned out that what I had to implement wasn't necessary. The biggest pain is that I analyzed it in terms of how to solve it and so I realized that we don't need it after 3 days 😪😭.

27/02/2020
---
As far as work is concerned, it was much better today 👍! After all, I know what to do 😉. In the evening I went with my cousin (who is getting married in July) to the pool to relax. ☺️

28/02/2020
---
It was a good Friday 😊👍! At work, I did everything according to plan so I had more time in the afternoon. Using it, I made myself a nice dinner. I spent the evening with my friends - we talked, played and ate unhealthy food 😆.

29/02/2020
---
Last day of February 😯! Today I went running with my friend - we did 5 km and finally endomondo started to measure the distance 🏃👍. During the day I wrote some of my thesis and in the evening - again with my friend - we went to the pool 🏊.

01/03/2020
---
Very standard Sunday - I was in church in the morning, then I studied and worked on the analysis of the Master's thesis code 😲. I do not like such Sundays 🤔... 

02/03/2020
---
Tough Monday 🤨. At work I was dealing with branches and a few people from the team didn't adjust to the git workflow and some inconveniences came out 😥.

03/03/2020
---
Today was much better :). Throughout the day I had meetings 🎧. Almost always after such a day my head explodes 🤯, and today it was fine 👍. After work we started the cycling season with my cousin 🚴🚴 - we drove a modest 20 km 🔥!

04/03/2020
---
It was a nice Wednesday 🤗. In the afternoon I went to Bialystok to study 🚗 and after class I went to my friends - on Wednesdays we have such meetings where we meet and talk about God 👍.

05/03/2020
---
I was in the office today 🤗. I had a conversation with my boss about my development in the company and so we talked in general. In the afternoon I cane home (to Hajnowka) and made myself an orange chicken 💪👨🍳.

06/03/2020
---
The last day of the HackerRank challenge 🤗 - that time has passed very quickly 😮! It turned out very well that this was the last day of the challenge because today we went to Silesia (and I will probably be more limited in time). In general this whole 'trip' is so spontaneous. I found out on Wednesday that there is such a possibility and I said - we are going! 😅

07/03/2020
---
It was wonderful Saturday ☺️. We are at Silesia and we have a really good time with God here. Also I've met new friends :)

08/03/2020
---
We stayed in Silesia until the evening 😲. But to be honest I don't regret it - we had a very good time there 😉👍.

09/03/2020
---
It was a great Monday 😉👍. I feel very spiritually built and I always want to have this state 💪. So this is a note to me - Bartek, at the end of the year, as you read this, mention the condition you have now, and if you do not have it, do it all to make this come back!

10/03/2020
---
I had a good day again, 😉! I skip work - everything was normal here. I spent the evening with my friend - we went to the pool and then we talked until late in the evening 👍.

11/03/2020
---
The world is scared of the coronavirus disease 😮. The Polish economy is going down like crazy - maybe it's time to invest some money on the stock market? 🤔

12/03/2020
---
Another great day 🤗🤗! Tonight I was in the church, then I went with my friend to the cauldron - the shelves were empty, people went crazy for fear of the virus 🙄.

13/03/2020
---
Friday 😎. It was very hard for me to work today - I couldn't concentrate on my work and I did little 🙄. I also invested some money in Orlen's shares today - I'm looking at it rather long term, we'll see what comes out of it 😏.

14/03/2020
---
The world has gone crazy 🤔. I am very curious to see if I will live to see the end of this year and be able to read my notes in peace if so thank God. It's getting weird in the world now 😥.

15/03/2020
---
It was a pleasant Sunday 🙂. In the morning I was in church, then we had a family dinner, then I visited my friend and in the evening I went to church again 👍👍.

16/03/2020
---
Monday 🧡! All in all, it was a good day. In the evening - despite the fact that I didn't have much desire - we got in the car with our friends and went to the forest to talk 😊.

17/03/2020
---
It was such a weird day 🤔. All the people around are panicking about the coronavirus 😶😶 - where does that get us all?

18/03/2020
---
Today it was beautiful outside - 15 degrees and you could feel the spring 😍😍. In the afternoon I went for a run, did 4 km. I was running and my cousin was riding a bike next door so we also talked a little 🙂.

19/03/2020
---
I really enjoyed today's 😉. The weather behind the window was poor but still I feel the spring is slowly coming 🤗. In the evening I could be at a service with my cousin, where the good word 👍 was preached.

20/03/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗. We start the weekend! Today I invited my cousin to dinner and made MEGA delicious turkey with rice, mushrooms and broccoli 🔪👨🍳❤. Then we went for a walk in the forest - a great feeling 👍.

21/03/2020
---
Today I spent almost the whole day writing the algorithm for my thesis 🤯🤯. In the meantime, I did some other things, e.g. I cleaned the room 😆.

22/03/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😉. In the morning, instead of going to church, we met in a group with friends (because of the ban on meeting more than 50 people). It was very nice (btw. I went there on foot 👟 - about 4 km one way). In the evening I had a short call with my thesis supervisor - he helped me a little with understanding the code 👍.

23/03/2020
---
It was a very productive day 💪🔥! I got up at 4:30am and started my day as always with one extra brick - a DNA course I bought yesterday. Besides, the day was like a day, everything was fine at work and after work I went to run with my friend and did 6 km 🏃🏃. I also managed to write a correctly naive version of the algorithm which I sat on yesterday with my promoter 😊.

24/03/2020
---
WoW! Today I managed to achieve one of my annual goals - to last 3:45 minutes without oxygen 👍👍! It's a pity that the pool is closed because I would probably be able to beat 50 meters underwater too 😏.

25/03/2020
---
The middle of the week and so far the hardest (in terms of time) day - I didn't even have time to do my training 😥. But I went running with my friend and we did 6.5 km 🏃. For the first time this year we ran together at my place.

26/03/2020
---
Today was a quiet day. I spent the whole day at home. A little study, a little blog - nothing special 😉.

27/03/2020
---
Time to start the weekend 😍! Today we went out on bikes with friends - we went to the forest 🤗. It is beautiful there! 

28/03/2020
---
Today we repeated the activity from yesterday and again we went by bike to the forest 🚴 - this time we did 30km. Later we made dinner at my place - it was quite good 👍.
