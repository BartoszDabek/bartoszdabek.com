First day of 2020 😲. I did 2 pretty important things today. First of all, I met with a friend of mine from high school and secondly I read my journal from 2019, which is quite interesting. It's interesting how my English developed throughout the year 😎.

02/01/2020
---
This year begins very much like the previous one. Once again I have a lot of work and I often go to the pool.😏🏊 

03/01/2020
---
I got sick 🤧! I woke up at 4 am with a cold but most of the day I felt pretty decent. Unfortunately, in the evening I felt terrible again 😭

04/01/2020
---
It was a very tough night 🤒. I think I was waking up like 10 times during the night 😒... Fortunately, I felt much better during the day, so I could write a review of 2019, which you can read [here](https://www.bdabek.pl/2020/01/04/podsumowanie-roku-2019/).

05/01/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😍. In the morning I was in church and in the evening my cousin and his fiancee invited me. Of course I took the opportunity :)

06/01/2020
---
Today we had a national holiday 🇵🇱. Thanks to that I could focus on my goals for this week ❤🔥!

07/01/2020
---
First day at work after a long weekend. Today we had a sprint review and we didn't accomplish many tasks 😎. Anyway... Today I also celebrated Orthodox Christmas with my family. We went to dinner at my grandmother's where our whole family was 🤗!

08/01/2020
---
Today I had to fix a few bugs in the tasks I pushed recently. I had a deadline. I don't like working under pressure 😰 and I don't think anyone does 👊.

09/01/2020
---
I have to control my time at work!! Once again, I've worked for 12 hours or more and no one will pay me for that extra hours 😩

10/01/2020
---
Friday 😍😍! It was a very good day. With God's help, I solved all the problems at work and could start the weekend at 3 pm with a very good mood! In the evening I went to the pool with my cousins - we talked and rested 👍

11/01/2020
---
Today I was at the funeral of my distant uncle ⛪. It's good to think about death and keep that in mind in your life. We should try to live in a way that doesn't waste time and give happienes to others! 🙆🏻‍♂️

12/01/2020
---
👋Sunday. It actually was a sunny day 😄. Today, after church I talked to one of my friends, who showed me his house. I spent the rest of the day at home ;]

13/01/2020
---
The week has begun! Today I went to the Bialystok and I'll stay here until Thursday. Thanks God that I have my own apartment!! 👍

14/01/2020
---
It's been a busy but pleasant day. I had to be at the university today and by the way I passed one subject 👨‍🎓👍. I also had to work late (7-8pm) because during the day I studied instead of working 🤫

15/01/2020
---
It was a nice day. I worked in my client's office today - it's cool to be there once in a while 😉. Later I had to go to the university - I had a presentation in one subject about multithreaded programming. And at the very end of the day my friends came by (actually, a friend rents a room from me and his fiancée came by) and we had a good time 👍👊.

16/01/2020
---
Back home :). I love this place where I was born - it is quiet and peaceful. Nature is not yet so much disturbed by technological progress and the human hand. Today's entry is very 'poetic' 😅.

17/01/2020
---
Another good day 🙂. No special revelations. At work I did my job and I'm going safely to the weekend 💪. Tomorrow I'll be a wedding witness and today we had an entry attempts  - it's rather not stressful, after all it's not my wedding 😄👰🤵.

18/01/2020
---
Wedding day 💒🔔🔔! I was a witness today but thank God I wasn't stressed out :). A beautiful wedding and a good wedding! 😉

19/01/2020
---
Sunday :). Today we had dinner together with the guests and the wedding couple. It was okay 😊. I talked with many friends and I think I had a good time 👊. In the evening I went with my cousin to the pool 🏊🏊.

20/01/2020
---
It was a good Monday. I had some free time and thanks to that I could spent the evening with my friend and his fiance 👍👍.

21/01/2020
---
Another beautiful day 😊. This time I had more work than yesterday, but maybe that's a good thing, at least I didn't waste time on some stupidity. In the evening we went to a friend's for dinner. It was tasty and funny 🥘😅.

22/01/2020
---
The next day when I spent the evening at someone 😏. It's good because this year is supposed to be different from the previous one where I mainly devoted my time to study and work. This time the goal is different - to spend time with family, friends - people more or less close to me 👊.

23/01/2020
---
It's been a hard day. I was doing an urgent patch to the application + a few other things stopped working...😪😪 From the positive things I came back to my beloved Hajnówka ❤.

24/01/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗! To be honest, I was very ineffective today. I solved the problems from yesterday (some of them solved themselves, I only got the information that it's ready) and then I took care of the organizational issues (docker, git). Sometimes it takes days like this to get a buzz off 🤯.

25/01/2020
---
Interesting Saturday 🙂. I guess I didn't do much - I was preparing to pass the subject for Monday and wrote a post on my blog, and yet I feel that I was productive 🤩. And in the evening, I went to the pool with my friends and then I bumped into friends for a while. 👊

26/01/2020
---
The wonderful day☺️. I could be at the service today and have lunch with my parents later. In the evening we went to listen to carols. It was a performance organized by the neighboring church. It was a very good time. 👍👍

27/01/2020
---
Yes! I passed the exam 👊! It's Monday and I felt very unproductive at work. I worked for really long time (10-12 hours?) and I feel like I did nothing 😪. At the end of the day, I noticed something very strange under my left eye - something like a bruise. I wonder, is it caused by fatigue or rather by sitting in front of the computer too long? 

28/01/2020
---
It was a bad day. I feel like I didn't do anything at work even though I worked 8 hours 😶... I also decided to come home earlier and I did - at 7pm I was in Hajnówka and spent the evening with my friends 🙂. 

29/01/2020
---
Today was much better than yesterday 👍👍. In fact, I was working on modifying one query to the database which took me a whole 8 hours. But at least I see some progress 🙂. Today I also went for a run with my friend - we ran about 4.5 km and then we went to the pool to take a bath 😂🤣.

30/01/2020
---
Today, with friends we went to visit our mutual friends together. We made pizzas 🍕🍕 and we had a nice evening ☺️! 

31/01/2020
---
Last day of January 😲! How quickly that time went by! Tonight I went to the pool again with my cousin 🏊.

01/02/2020
---
And it's the new month 👊! It was a nice day. I spent a lot of time studying or actually reading slides from the presentation - next week I will have 2 exams 👨🎓. In the evening - as is lately often - I went with my cousin to the swimming pool 💪💪 - I'm only worried about the fact that we go there mainly to relax and do not swim much...

02/02/2020
---
I'm in pain! After yesterday's pool, my back started hurting 😫😫! We were at my uncle's for his 50th birthday today. It was fun - we could meet the whole family but the pain was sometimes unbearable 😪.

03/02/2020
---
Monday. I was at a job interview today. I found out how much I don't know and after the interview I felt very bad - mentally - something like I lost some battle 😥. Nevertheless, this will always be a good thing, because now I'll go through all these topics myself and be richer with new knowledge 🤗!

04/02/2020
---
There it is! Finally I finished updating the documentation of the installation of our environments and at the same time I cleaned up some docker containers 👍👍.

05/02/2020
---
Tonight I got an answer after Monday's job interview. I was offered a junior position. It may seem like a step backwards but I think I can learn a lot there and I have to seriously consider 🤨🤨.

06/02/2020
---
The next day is over. Today, exceptionally, I wasn't going anywhere. I spent the whole day at home in front of the computer - I am not proud of it but I do not regret 😅. Slowly I have to present my mindset for writing my thesis 👨🎓.

07/02/2020
---
What a day it was... I took up a job and couldn't let go - one thing didn't work and it didn't leave me alone 😣. At the very end of the day I solved it 👍😊! Apart from that, I wrote about this job offer a few days earlier. I decided to reject it due to the lack of possibility to work remotely in 100% - and this is my goal. 

08/02/2020
---
A lot has happened today. In the morning, my cousin and I went to the countryside and we loaded the wood for firewood and then came back with a tractor 😄🚜. Then I went running with my friend and we did 6 km 🏃 (we had a very average time). At the end of the day - to relax - I went with my cousin to the pool 🤗.

09/02/2020
---
It was a wonderful Sunday 😍😍! It was very sunny. In the morning I was in the church and in the afternoon I went to see friends. At first we went for a walk and then we ate, talked and played some board games 😉.

10/02/2020
---
Today, however, the weather was terrible - it was raining and the wind was blowing. Despite everything I went running with my friend and we did 3.8km 🏃🏃. I think that this year's goal of 100km could have been raised to 200 😀.

11/02/2020
---
Ahhhh!! Today I almost reached the 50m underwater goal 🏊. I've swam 40-45 meters and surfaced. I'm a bit angry, because I still had oxygen to do 1-2 more repss. 💪💪

12/02/2020
---
It was a good day :). Nothing unusual happened, but still I'm satisfied. I spent the whole day at home and started to get acquainted with materials for my thesis 📗👍.

13/02/2020
---
Finally, I was able to finish the task at work - or actually pass it on for review 👍. Besides, it was an ordinary day and nothing interesting was going on 🙂.

14/02/2020
---
My roommate is sick and I feel that slowly this disease is also taking me 🤧🤧. Still, it was a good day 😉. Today I ran a little over 4.5km with my friend even though I did not feel 100% healthy 👍.

15/02/2020
---
And I got sick 😰🤒. I spent the whole day reading scientific papers on the subject of my thesis... My head is steaming after that day...🤯

16/02/2020
---
Today I felt much better - actually I almost recovered 🤗. Today I was only in church and spent the rest of the day at home 🏠. In the evening my cousin came to me and together we watched over my nephew 👶👶.

17/02/2020
---
It was a nice Monday 😎! It was very, VERY warm - 12 degrees in mid-February 🤯! I'm a little glad because I like it when it's warm and on the other hand I'm afraid for what's happening to the climate this year 😶.

18/02/2020
---
The next day passed 😏. Actually, I didn't do anything very valuable today. I finished a pdf with 10 keyboard shortcuts to IntelliJ and downloaded some repositories with the code to calculate k means 👍.

19/02/2020
---
Again, I haven't moved much from home, but I feel it was a good day 👍👍. We had some meetings at work today (in the meantime I did my home training), someone even went to my website and wrote a comment [bdabek.pl](bdabek.pl) 👊.

20/02/2020
---
Today I was at the pool with my cousin 💪. I could use this relaxation because today we had a lot of work with the git and all the branching 😮.

21/02/2020
---
Another good day! :) Today I was at the pool again - this time with my two buddies. My blog [bdabek.pl](bdabek.pl) has been approved for jvm-bloggers and gained a lot of traffic thanks to this 👍👍.

22/02/2020
---
Oh, yes! This Saturday started wonderfully 😍. It was sunny in the morning 😎 so I went running with my friend (we would have gone anyway), we did 6 km and then I went to him for breakfast. I started writing my thesis (I wrote one page 😅) and in the evening I went with my cousin to the pool to relax 🤗🤗.

23/02/2020
---
It was a good day until evening. I don't want to write what happened because it's private, but let's just say I'm a little angry.

24/02/2020
---
All day long it was very hard for me to focus 😥. At 4:30 p.m. I went running with a friend of mine and it took my emotions away. 

25/02/2020
---
This afternoon I went to Bialystok 🚗. It's time to start the last semester of studies! 👨🎓

26/02/2020
---
It's been a tough day 😨. It's mostly about work... it turned out that what I had to implement wasn't necessary. The biggest pain is that I analyzed it in terms of how to solve it and so I realized that we don't need it after 3 days 😪😭.

27/02/2020
---
As far as work is concerned, it was much better today 👍! After all, I know what to do 😉. In the evening I went with my cousin (who is getting married in July) to the pool to relax. ☺️

28/02/2020
---
It was a good Friday 😊👍! At work, I did everything according to plan so I had more time in the afternoon. Using it, I made myself a nice dinner. I spent the evening with my friends - we talked, played and ate unhealthy food 😆.

29/02/2020
---
Last day of February 😯! Today I went running with my friend - we did 5 km and finally endomondo started to measure the distance 🏃👍. During the day I wrote some of my thesis and in the evening - again with my friend - we went to the pool 🏊.

01/03/2020
---
Very standard Sunday - I was in church in the morning, then I studied and worked on the analysis of the Master's thesis code 😲. I do not like such Sundays 🤔... 

02/03/2020
---
Tough Monday 🤨. At work I was dealing with branches and a few people from the team didn't adjust to the git workflow and some inconveniences came out 😥.

03/03/2020
---
Today was much better :). Throughout the day I had meetings 🎧. Almost always after such a day my head explodes 🤯, and today it was fine 👍. After work we started the cycling season with my cousin 🚴🚴 - we drove a modest 20 km 🔥!

04/03/2020
---
It was a nice Wednesday 🤗. In the afternoon I went to Bialystok to study 🚗 and after class I went to my friends - on Wednesdays we have such meetings where we meet and talk about God 👍.

05/03/2020
---
I was in the office today 🤗. I had a conversation with my boss about my development in the company and so we talked in general. In the afternoon I cane home (to Hajnowka) and made myself an orange chicken 💪👨🍳.

06/03/2020
---
The last day of the HackerRank challenge 🤗 - that time has passed very quickly 😮! It turned out very well that this was the last day of the challenge because today we went to Silesia (and I will probably be more limited in time). In general this whole 'trip' is so spontaneous. I found out on Wednesday that there is such a possibility and I said - we are going! 😅

07/03/2020
---
It was wonderful Saturday ☺️. We are at Silesia and we have a really good time with God here. Also I've met new friends :)

08/03/2020
---
We stayed in Silesia until the evening 😲. But to be honest I don't regret it - we had a very good time there 😉👍.

09/03/2020
---
It was a great Monday 😉👍. I feel very spiritually built and I always want to have this state 💪. So this is a note to me - Bartek, at the end of the year, as you read this, mention the condition you have now, and if you do not have it, do it all to make this come back!

10/03/2020
---
I had a good day again, 😉! I skip work - everything was normal here. I spent the evening with my friend - we went to the pool and then we talked until late in the evening 👍.

11/03/2020
---
The world is scared of the coronavirus disease 😮. The Polish economy is going down like crazy - maybe it's time to invest some money on the stock market? 🤔

12/03/2020
---
Another great day 🤗🤗! Tonight I was in the church, then I went with my friend to the cauldron - the shelves were empty, people went crazy for fear of the virus 🙄.

13/03/2020
---
Friday 😎. It was very hard for me to work today - I couldn't concentrate on my work and I did little 🙄. I also invested some money in Orlen's shares today - I'm looking at it rather long term, we'll see what comes out of it 😏.

14/03/2020
---
The world has gone crazy 🤔. I am very curious to see if I will live to see the end of this year and be able to read my notes in peace if so thank God. It's getting weird in the world now 😥.

15/03/2020
---
It was a pleasant Sunday 🙂. In the morning I was in church, then we had a family dinner, then I visited my friend and in the evening I went to church again 👍👍.

16/03/2020
---
Monday 🧡! All in all, it was a good day. In the evening - despite the fact that I didn't have much desire - we got in the car with our friends and went to the forest to talk 😊.

17/03/2020
---
It was such a weird day 🤔. All the people around are panicking about the coronavirus 😶😶 - where does that get us all?

18/03/2020
---
Today it was beautiful outside - 15 degrees and you could feel the spring 😍😍. In the afternoon I went for a run, did 4 km. I was running and my cousin was riding a bike next door so we also talked a little 🙂.

19/03/2020
---
I really enjoyed today's 😉. The weather behind the window was poor but still I feel the spring is slowly coming 🤗. In the evening I could be at a service with my cousin, where the good word 👍 was preached.

20/03/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗. We start the weekend! Today I invited my cousin to dinner and made MEGA delicious turkey with rice, mushrooms and broccoli 🔪👨🍳❤. Then we went for a walk in the forest - a great feeling 👍.

21/03/2020
---
Today I spent almost the whole day writing the algorithm for my thesis 🤯🤯. In the meantime, I did some other things, e.g. I cleaned the room 😆.

22/03/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😉. In the morning, instead of going to church, we met in a group with friends (because of the ban on meeting more than 50 people). It was very nice (btw. I went there on foot 👟 - about 4 km one way). In the evening I had a short call with my thesis supervisor - he helped me a little with understanding the code 👍.

23/03/2020
---
It was a very productive day 💪🔥! I got up at 4:30am and started my day as always with one extra brick - a DNA course I bought yesterday. Besides, the day was like a day, everything was fine at work and after work I went to run with my friend and did 6 km 🏃🏃. I also managed to write a correctly naive version of the algorithm which I sat on yesterday with my promoter 😊.

24/03/2020
---
WoW! Today I managed to achieve one of my annual goals - to last 3:45 minutes without oxygen 👍👍! It's a pity that the pool is closed because I would probably be able to beat 50 meters underwater too 😏.

25/03/2020
---
The middle of the week and so far the hardest (in terms of time) day - I didn't even have time to do my training 😥. But I went running with my friend and we did 6.5 km 🏃. For the first time this year we ran together at my place.

26/03/2020
---
Today was a quiet day. I spent the whole day at home. A little study, a little blog - nothing special 😉.

27/03/2020
---
Time to start the weekend 😍! Today we went out on bikes with friends - we went to the forest 🤗. It is beautiful there! 

28/03/2020
---
Today we repeated the activity from yesterday and again we went by bike to the forest 🚴 - this time we did 30km. Later we made dinner at my place - it was quite good 👍.

29/03/2020
---
Oh, I didn't move at all today 😲 We had a family service at our house today so I just had to go down the stairs. It was a 'different' Sunday, but still very pleasant 😉. 

30/03/2020
---
And another Monday is behind us. 🙂 I had an online 'test' from the databases today - I think I did quite well 👍. 

31/03/2020
---
It was an ordinary day. I wasn't moving from home and I didn't do anything unusual 😶. I started my thesis a little bit, but no fireworks. Somehow today I missed the motivation to do 🤔.

01/04/2020
---
Wednesday is always a busy day 😓. You know, work and then classes... Just a little more and that's it 👍  !

02/04/2020
---
It was a good day 👍. During the day I went out to run with my friend and we did almost 6 km 💪. 

03/04/2020
---
There he is! Friday 😍. I had a good day again today. At work I started a topic that is difficult, but outside of work I have everything under control. Well, maybe outside of my MA thesis, which I planned to write this week and I barely started 🤨

04/04/2020
---
Today I did overtime at work 😮. Besides, I went out for a run with my friend and after the run we went to him and ate delicious homemade hamburgers 🍔.

05/04/2020
---
Wonderful Sunday 😍😍! In the morning we went to our uncle and auntie's, where we had a home service and then a family dinner. Later I came home on foot (about 5km) - but it was worth it - the weather was WONDERFUL 🤗🤗!

06/04/2020
---
Today was wonderful weather 😎😍! I don't even know what to write, but I know that the more this weather is outside, the less I want to study and work 😯. And I still have to finish my master's degree in 😪.

07/04/2020
---
Another great day! 👍 Today was even better weather than yesterday! Just today we had such a mini summer 😍😍. 

08/04/2020
---
Wednesday = little free time 😐. I had a colloquium from databases today + at work I'm also struggling with one bug on the production 😰... but soon a long weekend - on Friday I'm picking up overtime for the last Saturday 😉!

09/04/2020
---
Thank God it was a quiet day 😉. I solved yesterday's production problem and I can start a long weekend because tomorrow I'm taking a holiday 👍. 

10/04/2020
---
Today I spent the whole day writing my thesis ✍️.  In the afternoon I went cycling with my cousin and we drove 20 km through the forest 🌳🌲. 

11/04/2020
---
It's just beautiful 👌! Today I started to continue writing my thesis - I finished writing around noon. I thought I would write some more algorithm and it turned out that by the evening I had written a working algorithm in a single thread version 👍! And additionally, I ran 4km in the meantime and walked with my cousin for an hour on the tracks and forest 💪😊.

12/04/2020
---
First day of the Resurrection holidays 👍. We spent that day as a family. At first we had a service and then a family dinner 🍗🍗. It was a well spent Sunday 😉.

13/04/2020
---
And the second day of the holidays 👊🏼. This time we gathered at my parents' house. Just like yesterday, it was a cool time 👍🏼. 

14/04/2020
---
It was so hard for me to focus today 😫. I did almost nothing productive... I hope this is a temporary crisis 😅.

15/04/2020
---
It was rather a good day. It was hard for me to focus on work again... but at least this time I did some of the things on my todo list 👍🏼. 

16/04/2020
---
Today after work I went running and then I went to visit my friend. There was also my brother with his wife and child 😉. 

17/04/2020
---
I spent all day at home 🤔. I don't feel like writing anymore because this morning I got a little bit of a bad mood 😑.

18/04/2020
---
It was a strange day... Me and my friend went running to the woods to run and then on our way back we met the police 👮, who warned us that we can't do that. What a time...

19/04/2020
---
It was a bad start to the day... but thank God everything turned out to be better 😉. We were at Grandma's today - we had a service and then a family dinner 👍. Later in the afternoon I also went to visit my friend 👊.

20/04/2020
---
Time flies so fast...  It's almost the end of April. Today I was on a bike with my friend and we did 45 km 🚴🤯. I was very tired after coming back but also very happy 💪💪.

21/04/2020
---
It was just a regular Tuesday.The only place I moved out of the house was to go to my hairdresser... 🤔

22/04/2020
---
Wednesday - on this day I always have a lot on my mind because I still have 3 hours of studies outside of work. 😕 But today, despite the fact that I had to write a course pass and later present the progress of my MA thesis, I liked this Wednesday 😉.

23/04/2020
---
I'm glad that my pushups challenge is coming to an end 🤗. In recent days I have been short of vitamins because of exhaustion and some of my muscles have been vibrating e.g. while sitting 😯😯.

24/04/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤩! Not much happened today - I didn't even leave the house today (and it was warm outside, only there was no sun). I refreshed my website - I added and modified a new theme. Now it looks really cool 👍👍.

25/04/2020
---
Nice Saturday, 👍. Today I'm finishing my challenge with pumps. 💪 Together with my friend we ran 8 km today 😮 - although our pace was poor... but the distance counts. I also wrote several subsections of my thesis today ✍🏻👊🏻

26/04/2020
---
A wonderful Sunday - and I don't mean today's weather. In the morning I went with my dad to church 😊, and then I went to dinner to my family. In the evening, I took a walk during which a lot of ideas came up. Lesson learned to do more such walks 👍👍

27/04/2020
---
Monday 😍! I hope this is going to be a good week. Looking at the weather forecast, this is how it will be 👍🤗. And today's day didn't have any fireworks so I have nothing to describe 🙋♂.

28/04/2020
---
Nice day 😉. I cycled with my cousin today - we did about 30 km 🚴👍.

29/04/2020
---
Wednesday 😪. Outside the window it got ugly and yet, as always, on Wednesday, I had a lot of classes 😫. But it wasn't such a bad day in general 🙄.

30/04/2020
---
It is time to prepare for the next long weekend 👍🏼. That's good because I have some things to do (writing my thesis)...🏃🏽

01/05/2020
---
And we have May 😍! I think it's one of the most beautiful seasons... Today was a job holiday in Poland, so I didn't work 🤗, instead I wrote an article on my blog and tried to write my MA, but nothing came out of it 🤔.

It was an insanely productive day 👊🏼💪🏼! I finished writing the chapter of my thesis, wrote tests for the algorithm, improved it so that there are no thread races... and additionally, I went for a walk and walked about 6 km (it's beautiful in the forest 😍).

03/05/2020
---
Today we celebrated my nephew's birthday and my 😊. I have a birthday tomorrow and my nephew on Wednesday. We had a nice family time 😉.

04/05/2020
---
Today is my birthday 😉. Let me put it this way - I am grateful to God for the whole 26 years I have had - I have a wonderful life and family 🤗! And now let's go back to today. In the afternoon the weather got wonderful 😍😍 and together with my friend we went running - we did 9 km 😯!

05/05/2020
---
I don't know what to say about today. The day wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either... I know for sure I wasn't very productive and somehow I didn't feel like doing anything 😥😥.

06/05/2020
---
It was a very hard day and not only because I had a class today. Around noon I started to feel very bad and it kept me going until the evening, but thank God the evening was all right 🤗. 

07/05/2020
---
It wasn't the best day. I got busy and didn't even go out into the fresh air. I have a lot on my mind lately - I have to start telling others no and slowly empty my stack 🤯.

08/05/2020
---
And today, on the contrary, it was a good day ☺️. Today I also spent the whole day at home but still felt better mentally, hmm..😏

09/05/2020
---
It was good Saturday, 👍. I finished the second chapter of my thesis 🤗. In addition, we went on bikes with my cousin 🚴, but we had an interesting adventure... About 15 km from home a tire got punctured. Fortunately, my dad came and took the bike 🙏🏼.

10/05/2020
---
It was by far the best Sunday this year 🤗🤗 both in terms of weather and how I spent it 👍🏼. We had a family meeting in the morning and then lunch together. Later I went cycling with my friends and we had a nice afternoon and evening 💪🏼💪🏼! 

11/05/2020
---
A wonderful day - weather like in summer 😍😍! I didn't take too much advantage of it because today I focused very much on work and didn't even go out to run 😒😒.

12/05/2020
---
Amazing, it was snowing this morning ❄️🤯! It was a good day - I even went and ran 3 km (to get rid of stress from work).

13/05/2020
---
That was the worst day in a long time 😓. I removed the wrong table from the database by my ignorance, so I worked until tonight...

14/05/2020
---
Today it wasn't easy again, but thank God all problems at work were finally solved 🙏. After work - to relax - I went with my cousin on bikes and then I made a home kebab 🔪! It was tasty !!!! 👍🏼👍🏼 

15/05/2020
---
Friday 😍. I waited a long time for this day - because it was a tough week. Today, after work, I went on a bike and drove 17 km 🚴🚴. I think that sport is just some way to relieve the stress 😏.

16/05/2020
---
This Saturday wasn't promising to be an interesting day - the weather was cloudy and not encouraging 🌫️... Until the afternoon I sat at home and wrote my thesis ✍🏽. Later my cousin proposed to go to Bialowieza and we did it. We went in 4 to Bialowieza and came from the village - together we walked 7 km! When we came back, I went running with my friend 🏃🏃, so in the end it was an intense day 🤗.

17/05/2020
---
A wonderful Sunday 🤗😍! We were all family today at Grandma and Grandpa's. It was a really good family time (and later a very good dinner 👍🏼). Later I came home and with God's help I managed to write the last algorithm for my thesis! Yupii! 😀😀

18/05/2020
---
It was definitely a nice Monday 😍! Weather was lousy but still I had a lot of energy :). Additionally there were also customers to watch the apartment for rent 😏.

19/05/2020
---
Ahhh... It was a weird day 🤔, nothing was wrong but on the other hand it wasn't good either. I had a technical interview today and it went wrong - that's probably the reason.

20/05/2020
---
Surprisingly, it was good Wednesday 🙂. I always had a lot of work to do for the class but this time everything went somehow smoothly + I still ran 4 km during the class 👍🏽.

21/05/2020
---
It was a good day. Everything was calm and in the afternoon I went out with my cousins on a bicycle 👍 (although it was very windy and not easy to ride).

22/05/2020
---
Beautiful Friday! 😊. Maybe the weather wasn't the best, but finally the weekend starts 😋. I noticed that I need to focus more on the details of what I do - a note for the future.

23/05/2020
---
This was by far the best Saturday of the year 😍😍! In the morning, I grasped the things I had to do and then it started. I went with my cousin's bike to my grandmother's 🚴, then I went to play beach volleyball with my friends, then to barbecue to them and at the end I went to a friend from my teenage years and we could remember the old days... Beautiful day 🤗!

24/05/2020
---
And another wonderful day 😍. For most of the day the weather was bad but in the evening the sun was shining. In the morning I was in church and then at my cousin's birthday party. And in the evening I went for a walk 🤗🤗.

25/05/2020
---
It's amazing how quickly that time passes. It was an ordinary Monday without revelation - in the evening I went to run 4 km 🙃.

26/05/2020
---
Hmm... I don't know what to say about today - it was okay. Out of the cooler things, today I went on bikes with my cousin 😅.

27/05/2020
---
Another good day :). It's probably another Wednesday when the combination of work and study is not a kind of challenge 😏. Maybe because I focus a little less on studies 🤫...

28/05/2020
---
Unexpected overtime at work came to me today 😮. Actually, I'm glad because I just needed those extra hours 😄. 

29/05/2020
---
It's cool because Friday, but we have a big topic at work and we have to do overtime on Saturday 🤔🤔.

30/05/2020
---
Ahhh... what a day. It's been raining all day 😕. It wouldn't change much in my life because I've been working from morning to evening anyway. One more thing... I was wrong and the blog posting went 5 hours later than I planned. 🙄

31/05/2020
---
And the last day of May 😮! It was a beautiful Sunday. In the morning I was in the church and in the afternoon we went to the neighboring church and had a good time together with the youth. There was a grill and volleyball 🤗👍🏻.

1/06/2020
---
Today I listened to an interesting episode of the podcast [TPS](https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/301-journaling/) about keeping such an everyday diary. I want to check how certain things will work out for me, so now in such daily notes I'll always briefly mention yesterday - what I managed to do or what I am grateful for (because I always write my diary in the morning) and then one plan for today 👍🏼. So today's plan is to write a thoughtful agenda for the blog post.

2/06/2020
---
It took all day yesterday to write application audit logs... and as it turned out, in the end it doesn't work anyway 😣! Yesterday, instead of finishing work normally at 3:00 p.m. I was sitting on those logs until 9:00 p.m... it was a mistake. That's why I didn't do yesterday's plan which was to write an agenda for the blog. That's why I'm postponing it until today.

3/06/2020
---
Yesterday's day was much better ☺️. I finished my work at normal time, went running with my friend, made small changes in the algorithm for my thesis and yet I wrote the agenda for the post blog 👍🏼👍🏼. Today I want to improve the test scenarios for my thesis and write one section of the blog post 💪🏼. 

4/06/2020
---
Yesterday's day was cool 😏. I took a light and pleasant topic at work. After work I went to play beach volleyball, then I went out with my cousin on bicycles and at the end of the day I corrected the scripts for my thesis. Yesterday I didn't manage to write a blog so today I will have to write the majority - we can do it 😎.

5/06/2020
---
Another nice day. Yesterday, thank God, I didn't have much work 😉. I wrote some content for a blog article and in the evening I went for a walk in the forest 🌳🌳. Today I will finish the blog and enjoy this beautiful Saturday! 😎😍

6/06/2020
---
That day was exactly as I described it - I wrote an article and then from noon to evening something was still going on - bike, volleyball, sunbathing, grill 😍🤗. Something wonderful! Such moments are beautiful! There are no plans for today. It is Sunday - the Lord's day. If I do something, it is only as an additional activity 😉.

7/06/2020
---
Wonderful, beautiful Sunday 😍😍! The whole day was very sunny 😎. Yesterday, despite the fact that I didn't plan to do so, I managed to correct the scripts and write an article on the blog. Today I'm going to read an article about architects' guild and enter results of some scripts into excel. 👍

8/06/2020
---
Another beautiful day 🤗. I didn't manage to read the article about architects' guild, but I made a beautiful template for test results 😁. The plan for today is simple - finish reading the article and run at least 5 km 🏃🏃.

9/06/2020
---
It's been a bit stupid for me to write it again in a row but it was another great day 😅 . Yesterday I ran over 6 km and read the article + additionally I rewrote the test results to excel 👍. Plan for today - clean up the room, pack up for the trip (I'm going to the mountains and from tomorrow to Sunday I don't use a computer) and ride 30 km by bike 🚴🚴.

10-13/06/2020
---
Yesterday I did not manage to ride my bike because of the weather - it was raining heavily from noon to evening 😒. By the way - I am changing the dates in this diary so that yesterday's day is really yesterday. But it is not important at this point - the most important is that I am going to the mountains :). I will not use the computer until Sunday - and that is the goal. Turn off and cut off completely from the Internet life 🙂. I'm off, bye! 👋

14/06/2020
---
I just got back from the mountains. It was wonderful. I completely calmed down + we got some mountain summits 🙃🙃. The views are indescribable ☺️.

15/06/2020
---
As for yesterday, I don't have much to say. After the trip I went to sleep and slept for a long time 😆. Plan for today - finish the project for the studies and prepare for its presentation and additionally make an agenda for the blog entry. 👊🏽

16/06/2020
---
The plan for yesterday was done 💪. The whole day yesterday was fine - I cycled 20 km 🚴. Today I want to make corrections after my promoter's comments to my thesis and write one section in the blog post.

17/06/2020
---
Yesterday, there was beautiful weather since the afternoon 😍. I took full advantage of both the weather and the fact that I was on holiday 😎😎. But today I have to get back to work 😋. The plan for today is to complete all the studies and finish writing (or maybe more exploring) yesterday's blog post.

18/06/2020
---
And again, a beautiful day. I went cycling with my cousin today and when we were coming back we were caught in heavy rain 😆. Although I got wet, I'm still happy 😅😅. Yesterday I did not manage to do anything with the blog post, so this is my main mission today.

19/06/2020
---
Yesterday I ran over 5 km 🏃, wrote a large part of the article on the blog and at the end of the day I came up with an idea to solve the problem at work 😀. Aah because I didn't mention it - for most of the day I was struggling with an architectural problem at work and I couldn't think of anything... The goal for today: to finish writing an article on the blog ✍🏽.

20/06/2020
---
Yesterday I failed to achieve my goal. But nothing happened. I'll do it today 👍. Why didn't I succeed? I've read a lot about what I'm writing and spent a lot of time debugging the code. So the plan for today is to finish the blog article and enjoy the day - go cycling or something 😎😍.

21/06/2020
---
Yesterday's day was 100% successful 👊. The last days are really beautiful and sunny - I love it 😍! Today is Sunday so I have no plans - I'll just enjoy life and see what comes out 😉.

22/06/2020
---
Yesterday, unfortunately, the weather wasn't good. It was warm but cloudy and rainy - only in the evening the weather became pleasant 😏. Nevertheless, yesterday's Sunday was fine - I was 2x in church at the morning and evening service 🙃. And what are my plans for today? Write an agenda for the blog post and if the weather is good, go out on a bike.

23/06/2020
---
The whole day yesterday was cloudy but there was no rain and thanks to that I could go out with my cousin on a bike 😏. The plan for today is to finish writing an article on the blog 👍🏻.

24/06/2020
---
Yesterday it was cloudy and quite cold for the last days 😢. Thanks to that I managed to write a post on the blog 😆. Plan for today: run at least 6 km and write a subsection of my thesis 👨🎓.

25/06/2020
---
I didn't manage to fulfill 100% of yesterday's plan because I didn't write a sub-section of my thesis - at least I buried it there a bit and changed the sequence diagram. BUT I managed to run 10km below 50 minutes 🏃💪🏼 yesterday - so the annual plan is done! And the goal for today is, of course, to finish writing this subsection of my MA thesis 😉.

26/06/2020
---
God gave another beautiful day yesterday 😍😍. I did everything I planned and additionally I cycled 30 km with my cousin 🚴. The plan for today is to propose cooperation on the blog and prepare a new project for the blog ☺️.

27/06/2020
---
And the weekend started - it started beautifully. Yesterday's weather was Wonderful 😍. I managed to carry out another annual plan - to ride 600 km by bike during the year 🚴. I also talked to my friend about the cooperation on the blog and I see that it goes in the right direction 👍. What about today? I have an article to read about transactionality and then the wedding! 😁👰

28/06/2020
---
Yesterday (and practically still today) I was at the wedding 🤵♂ 👰♂️. It was fun 👍🏻👍🏻. Plan for today? Enjoy a beautiful and sunny Sunday 😎🤗.

29/06/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😏. I was at the wedding rehearsals and really enjoyed the beautiful weather all day. Thank God I also had the desire and opportunity to be at both services 🙂. Plan for today: write an agenda for the blog.

30/06/2020
---
This is the last day of the month 😮! Time flies incredibly fast so it's worth enjoying moments... As for yesterday I didn't manage to do anything with the agenda for the blog, and today I certainly won't do it either. Today I will have two technical talks so the plan for today is no plan 🤣.

01/07/2020
---
Yesterday's day wasn't an easy one 🤯, but I think I did quite well on both interviews I had 👍.Today I have one more conversation waiting - but a little less important 🤫. The plan for today is to finally write an agenda for the blog 😅.

02/07/2020
---
So far I have a very good week... Yesterday's technical interview went quite well and I had feedback response from the other interview which is not that bad (it's quite good actually). Yesterday mission to write agenda for the blog is done :). Today mission is to write a whole blog post because on Friday I'm at the wedding (again).

03/07/2020
---
I couldn't do yesterday's task with writing a blog 😢. I didn't even start it... Yesterday's day was very busy and in fact, when I finished work at 15, I didn't turn on the computer for my own purposes. The plan for today is to write +/- valid article and have fun at the wedding 🤣👍.

04/07/2020
---
Yesterday I got up at 4 a.m. and I was getting up at 4 a.m. and I still didn't have enough time for everything 🙄. And yet, I managed to do yesterday's goal - to write an almost finished article for the blog. The mission for today is to finish and 'polish' the details and later on the bike and wedding rehearsal. 

05/07/2020
---
Yesterday was wonderful 🤗. I went by bike to the wedding rehearsals. We had a beautiful weather and I spent time from noon to very evening in a nice atmosphere. Thank God for all this 🙏. Today is Sunday, so it is standard - no plan for today - we enjoy life 🙂🙂.

06/07/2020
---
I had a tough night - I got up and felt like I was going to throw up 😨🤒. It's a little better now - I still have a slight headache but I believe God will help me. The plan for today is simple: write an agenda for a blog.

07/07/2020
---
Monday passed very pleasantly - it was the last such hot day, now for the next few days the temperature will be lower 😢. Yesterday I managed to write an agenda for my blog and ride a few kilometers by bike ✍🏼💪🏼. The plan for today is to finish the article on the blog 🙂. 

08/07/2020
---
Yesterday it was cloudy and I had this feeling for a while that it was like autumn. But it's summer and now I see the beautiful sun outside 😍. I couldn't achieve yesterday's plan in 100%, so today I will finish writing an article for the blog.

09/07/2020
---
Again, I failed to complete the plan - to write a blog. I forgot to write about it earlier, but on July 7 I managed to finish my annual sports goal - to run 200km 💪🏼🏆. I am very pleased with it 🤗. The plan for today is the same as yesterday - to finish this blog post. 

10/07/2020
---
I finally managed to finish the article on the blog 😛. That's good because this week I have to write a subsection of my thesis and at the weekend I have another wedding 😅.Well, I actually wrote plan for today - my thesis.

11/07/2020
---
I wrote or maybe modified a little bit of my thesis yesterday, but I haven't managed to finish the whole chapter I planned. In fact, I have 2 drawings left to complete and that's it - I will have 3 chapters of the thesis finished. Today will be my cousin's wedding - I hope it will be a blessed time 🙂. 

12/07/2020
---
Yesterday I completed the third chapter of my thesis and then the wedding 👰. It was a different wedding... there wasn't much going on at it 🤔. But for me it doesn't matter that much - I talked to my friends and at least it ended earlier, so I got some sleep 😅😅.
