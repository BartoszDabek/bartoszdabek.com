First day of 2020 😲. I did 2 pretty important things today. First of all, I met with a friend of mine from high school and secondly I read my journal from 2019, which is quite interesting. It's interesting how my English developed throughout the year 😎.

This year begins very much like the previous one. Once again I have a lot of work and I often go to the pool.😏🏊

I got sick 🤧! I woke up at 4 am with a cold but most of the day I felt pretty decent. Unfortunately, in the evening I felt terrible again 😭

It was a very tough night 🤒. I think I was waking up like 10 times during the night 😒... Fortunately, I felt much better during the day, so I could write a review of 2019, which you can read [here](https://www.bdabek.pl/2020/01/04/podsumowanie-roku-2019/).

It was a good Sunday 😍. In the morning I was in church and in the evening my cousin and his fiancee invited me. Of course I took the opportunity :)

First day at work after a long weekend. Today we had a sprint review and we didn't accomplish many tasks 😎. Anyway... Today I also celebrated Orthodox Christmas with my family. We went to dinner at my grandmother's where our whole family was 🤗!

Today I had to fix a few bugs in the tasks I pushed recently. I had a deadline. I don't like working under pressure 😰 and I don't think anyone does 👊.

I have to control my time at work!! Once again, I've worked for 12 hours or more and no one will pay me for that extra hours 😩

Friday 😍😍! It was a very good day. With God's help, I solved all the problems at work and could start the weekend at 3 pm with a very good mood! In the evening I went to the pool with my cousins - we talked and rested 👍

Today I was at the funeral of my distant uncle ⛪. It's good to think about death and keep that in mind in your life. We should try to live in a way that doesn't waste time and give happienes to others! 🙆🏻‍♂️

👋Sunday. It actually was a sunny day 😄. Today, after church I talked to one of my friends, who showed me his house. I spent the rest of the day at home ;]

It's been a busy but pleasant day. I had to be at the university today and by the way I passed one subject 👨‍🎓👍. I also had to work late (7-8pm) because during the day I studied instead of working 🤫

It was a nice day. I worked in my client's office today - it's cool to be there once in a while 😉. Later I had to go to the university - I had a presentation in one subject about multithreaded programming. And at the very end of the day my friends came by (actually, a friend rents a room from me and his fiancée came by) and we had a good time 👍👊.

Back home :). I love this place where I was born - it is quiet and peaceful. Nature is not yet so much disturbed by technological progress and the human hand. Today's entry is very 'poetic' 😅.

Another good day 🙂. No special revelations. At work I did my job and I'm going safely to the weekend 💪. Tomorrow I'll be a wedding witness and today we had an entry attempts  - it's rather not stressful, after all it's not my wedding 😄👰🤵.
