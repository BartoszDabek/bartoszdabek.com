First day of 2020 😲. I did 2 pretty important things today. First of all, I met with a friend of mine from high school and secondly I read my journal from 2019, which is quite interesting. It's interesting how my English developed throughout the year 😎.

02/01/2020

This year begins very much like the previous one. Once again I have a lot of work and I often go to the pool.😏🏊 

03/01/2020

I got sick 🤧! I woke up at 4 am with a cold but most of the day I felt pretty decent. Unfortunately, in the evening I felt terrible again 😭

04/01/2020
---
It was a very tough night 🤒. I think I was waking up like 10 times during the night 😒... Fortunately, I felt much better during the day, so I could write a review of 2019, which you can read [here](https://www.bdabek.pl/2020/01/04/podsumowanie-roku-2019/).

It was a good Sunday 😍. In the morning I was in church and in the evening my cousin and his fiancee invited me. Of course I took the opportunity :)

06/01/2020

Today we had a national holiday 🇵🇱. Thanks to that I could focus on my goals for this week ❤🔥!

07/01/2020

First day at work after a long weekend. Today we had a sprint review and we didn't accomplish many tasks 😎. Anyway... Today I also celebrated Orthodox Christmas with my family. We went to dinner at my grandmother's where our whole family was 🤗!

08/01/2020
---
Today I had to fix a few bugs in the tasks I pushed recently. I had a deadline. I don't like working under pressure 😰 and I don't think anyone does 👊.

09/01/2020
---
I have to control my time at work!! Once again, I've worked for 12 hours or more and no one will pay me for that extra hours 😩

10/01/2020
---
Friday 😍😍! It was a very good day. With God's help, I solved all the problems at work and could start the weekend at 3 pm with a very good mood! In the evening I went to the pool with my cousins - we talked and rested 👍

11/01/2020
---
Today I was at the funeral of my distant uncle ⛪. It's good to think about death and keep that in mind in your life. We should try to live in a way that doesn't waste time and give happienes to others! 🙆🏻‍♂️

12/01/2020

👋Sunday. It actually was a sunny day 😄. Today, after church I talked to one of my friends, who showed me his house. I spent the rest of the day at home ;]

13/01/2020
---
The week has begun! Today I went to the Bialystok and I'll stay here until Thursday. Thanks God that I have my own apartment!! 👍

14/01/2020

It's been a busy but pleasant day. I had to be at the university today and by the way I passed one subject 👨‍🎓👍. I also had to work late (7-8pm) because during the day I studied instead of working 🤫

15/01/2020
---
It was a nice day. I worked in my client's office today - it's cool to be there once in a while 😉. Later I had to go to the university - I had a presentation in one subject about multithreaded programming. And at the very end of the day my friends came by (actually, a friend rents a room from me and his fiancée came by) and we had a good time 👍👊.

16/01/2020
---
Back home :). I love this place where I was born - it is quiet and peaceful. Nature is not yet so much disturbed by technological progress and the human hand. Today's entry is very 'poetic' 😅.

17/01/2020
---
Another good day 🙂. No special revelations. At work I did my job and I'm going safely to the weekend 💪. Tomorrow I'll be a wedding witness and today we had an entry attempts  - it's rather not stressful, after all it's not my wedding 😄👰🤵.

18/01/2020
---
Wedding day 💒🔔🔔! I was a witness today but thank God I wasn't stressed out :). A beautiful wedding and a good wedding! 😉

19/01/2020
---
Sunday :). Today we had dinner together with the guests and the wedding couple. It was okay 😊. I talked with many friends and I think I had a good time 👊. In the evening I went with my cousin to the pool 🏊🏊.

20/01/2020
---
It was a good Monday. I had some free time and thanks to that I could spent the evening with my friend and his fiance 👍👍.

21/01/2020
---
Another beautiful day 😊. This time I had more work than yesterday, but maybe that's a good thing, at least I didn't waste time on some stupidity. In the evening we went to a friend's for dinner. It was tasty and funny 🥘😅.

22/01/2020
---
The next day when I spent the evening at someone 😏. It's good because this year is supposed to be different from the previous one where I mainly devoted my time to study and work. This time the goal is different - to spend time with family, friends - people more or less close to me 👊.

23/01/2020

It's been a hard day. I was doing an urgent patch to the application + a few other things stopped working...😪😪 From the positive things I came back to my beloved Hajnówka ❤.

24/01/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗! To be honest, I was very ineffective today. I solved the problems from yesterday (some of them solved themselves, I only got the information that it's ready) and then I took care of the organizational issues (docker, git). Sometimes it takes days like this to get a buzz off 🤯.

25/01/2020

Interesting Saturday 🙂. I guess I didn't do much - I was preparing to pass the subject for Monday and wrote a post on my blog, and yet I feel that I was productive 🤩. And in the evening, I went to the pool with my friends and then I bumped into friends for a while. 👊

26/01/2020
---
The wonderful day☺️. I could be at the service today and have lunch with my parents later. In the evening we went to listen to carols. It was a performance organized by the neighboring church. It was a very good time. 👍👍

27/01/2020
---
Yes! I passed the exam 👊! It's Monday and I felt very unproductive at work. I worked for really long time (10-12 hours?) and I feel like I did nothing 😪. At the end of the day, I noticed something very strange under my left eye - something like a bruise. I wonder, is it caused by fatigue or rather by sitting in front of the computer too long? 

28/01/2020
---
It was a bad day. I feel like I didn't do anything at work even though I worked 8 hours 😶... I also decided to come home earlier and I did - at 7pm I was in Hajnówka and spent the evening with my friends 🙂. 

29/01/2020
---
Today was much better than yesterday 👍👍. In fact, I was working on modifying one query to the database which took me a whole 8 hours. But at least I see some progress 🙂. Today I also went for a run with my friend - we ran about 4.5 km and then we went to the pool to take a bath 😂🤣.

30/01/2020

Today, with friends we went to visit our mutual friends together. We made pizzas 🍕🍕 and we had a nice evening ☺️! 

31/01/2020
---
Last day of January 😲! How quickly that time went by! Tonight I went to the pool again with my cousin 🏊.

01/02/2020
---
And it's the new month 👊! It was a nice day. I spent a lot of time studying or actually reading slides from the presentation - next week I will have 2 exams 👨🎓. In the evening - as is lately often - I went with my cousin to the swimming pool 💪💪 - I'm only worried about the fact that we go there mainly to relax and do not swim much...

02/02/2020
---
I'm in pain! After yesterday's pool, my back started hurting 😫😫! We were at my uncle's for his 50th birthday today. It was fun - we could meet the whole family but the pain was sometimes unbearable 😪.

03/02/2020

Monday. I was at a job interview today. I found out how much I don't know and after the interview I felt very bad - mentally - something like I lost some battle 😥. Nevertheless, this will always be a good thing, because now I'll go through all these topics myself and be richer with new knowledge 🤗!

04/02/2020
---
There it is! Finally I finished updating the documentation of the installation of our environments and at the same time I cleaned up some docker containers 👍👍.

05/02/2020
---
Tonight I got an answer after Monday's job interview. I was offered a junior position. It may seem like a step backwards but I think I can learn a lot there and I have to seriously consider 🤨🤨.

06/02/2020
---
The next day is over. Today, exceptionally, I wasn't going anywhere. I spent the whole day at home in front of the computer - I am not proud of it but I do not regret 😅. Slowly I have to present my mindset for writing my thesis 👨🎓.

07/02/2020
---
What a day it was... I took up a job and couldn't let go - one thing didn't work and it didn't leave me alone 😣. At the very end of the day I solved it 👍😊! Apart from that, I wrote about this job offer a few days earlier. I decided to reject it due to the lack of possibility to work remotely in 100% - and this is my goal. 

08/02/2020

A lot has happened today. In the morning, my cousin and I went to the countryside and we loaded the wood for firewood and then came back with a tractor 😄🚜. Then I went running with my friend and we did 6 km 🏃 (we had a very average time). At the end of the day - to relax - I went with my cousin to the pool 🤗.

09/02/2020

It was a wonderful Sunday 😍😍! It was very sunny. In the morning I was in the church and in the afternoon I went to see friends. At first we went for a walk and then we ate, talked and played some board games 😉.

10/02/2020
---
Today, however, the weather was terrible - it was raining and the wind was blowing. Despite everything I went running with my friend and we did 3.8km 🏃🏃. I think that this year's goal of 100km could have been raised to 200 😀.

11/02/2020
---
Ahhhh!! Today I almost reached the 50m underwater goal 🏊. I've swam 40-45 meters and surfaced. I'm a bit angry, because I still had oxygen to do 1-2 more repss. 💪💪

12/02/2020
---
It was a good day :). Nothing unusual happened, but still I'm satisfied. I spent the whole day at home and started to get acquainted with materials for my thesis 📗👍.

13/02/2020
---
Finally, I was able to finish the task at work - or actually pass it on for review 👍. Besides, it was an ordinary day and nothing interesting was going on 🙂.

14/02/2020

My roommate is sick and I feel that slowly this disease is also taking me 🤧🤧. Still, it was a good day 😉. Today I ran a little over 4.5km with my friend even though I did not feel 100% healthy 👍.

15/02/2020

And I got sick 😰🤒. I spent the whole day reading scientific papers on the subject of my thesis... My head is steaming after that day...🤯
