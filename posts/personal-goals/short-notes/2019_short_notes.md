First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

Today I did a workout 💪💪 and went to the swimming pool 🏊. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time.

What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

5th day of 2019 officialy ended. Today I coocked a really tasty meal! Chicken with rice (sounds normal, but it was SUPER good). Tomorrow I'll add some vegetables (especially broccoli) to this. I like cooking! 🔪👍

Today after back from work I ate dinner and with roommates we started cleaning our flat. It took us almost 3 hours to clean it all. I feel proud of us because we were planning that since few months but noone wasn't to take an action and today - we all took!

I had my thesis presentation on seminar at studies. It is always kind of stressfull when I have to present something in front of a people. But I did it and the result is that I have to prepare better and cut the duration.

Sunday. I ate dinner with my family at my parents. It is always good to spend time with your family. I love them and it is really important for everyone to respect family and find time for them!

It was a pretty tough day! I got off from work a little bit earlier because I had to do some papers to school. But after returning to home I had few emails about new tasks. Beside of that I had to make some project on studies with my colleague. A lot of things to do and the day is only 24h :D.

Studying, studying, studying... Lately there is a lot of this. My day very often looks like this: work > dinner after work > workout > studying. But to be honest, I like to study :)

I slept 10 hours and I don't feel bad about it. I know that my body sometimes needs a longer rest and if I can do it, I do it.
