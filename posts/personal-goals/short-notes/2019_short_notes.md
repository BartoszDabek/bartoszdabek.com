First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

02/01/2019
---
Today I did a workout üí™üí™ and went to the swimming pool üèä. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time. 

03/01/2019

What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

04/01/2019
---
Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

5th day of 2019 officialy ended. Today I coocked a really tasty meal! Chicken with rice (sounds normal, but it was SUPER good). Tomorrow I'll add some vegetables (especially broccoli) to this. I like cooking! üî™üëç

06/01/2019

I forgot about this completely! It's a day after and I realized I didn't write anything here. Shame on me!

07/01/2019

Totday was 1st real work day in this year. We had a meeting with summary of what is left to do. I was also celebrating 2nd Christmas (Orthodox) with family. Here, where I live, we're celebrating everything :D.

08/01/2019
---
First day in the office in this year. I've not been in the office since almost 3 weeks! It's good to be back in here :)

09/01/2019
---
It was a good day. In work all is on a good road. The only thing I missing is knowledge :D. I need to learn more and learn harder to be a better developer!!

10/01/2019
---
Today after back from work I ate dinner and with roommates we started cleaning our flat. It took us almost 3 hours to clean it all. I feel proud of us because we were planning that since few months but noone wasn't to take an action and today - we all took!

11/01/2019
---
Today 2 of my friends came to our flat. They have studies this weekend and that's the reason why. It was a fun evening :).

12/01/2019
---
I had my thesis presentation on seminar at studies. It is always kind of stressfull when I have to present something in front of a people. But I did it and the result is that I have to prepare better and cut the duration. 

13/01/2019
---
Sunday. I ate dinner with my family at my parents. It is always good to spend time with your family. I love them and it is really important for everyone to respect family and find time for them!

14/01/2019
---
Our production server was down the whole day. I had a time to learn something new and to focus a little bit on my stuff.

15/01/2019
---
It was a pretty tough day! I got off from work a little bit earlier because I had to do some papers to school. But after returning to home I had few emails about new tasks. Beside of that I had to make some project on studies with my colleague. A lot of things to do and the day is only 24h :D.

16/01/2019
---
Studying, studying, studying... Lately there is a lot of this. My day very often looks like this: work > dinner after work > workout > studying. But to be honest, I like to study :)

17/01/2019
---
Today in work we had a meeting about future and the current state of our project. In the end of the March we'll have a final decision if project go further or fails. Beside of that it was a good day! üëçüëç

18/01/2019

I had awesome day! And honestly, I don't know why... I had the feeling of coming spring and I LOVE it. I really want it to be spring now! Today I also came back to my hometown for a weekend :)

19/01/2019
---
I slept 10 hours and I don't feel bad about it. I know that my body sometimes needs a longer rest and if I can do it, I do it.

20/01/2019
---
Today after dinner I came back to Bialystok (the place where I work). To be honest, I don't know how long I'll stay here (I mean in the flat I currently living) because my roommate is moving out and we had a good relationships.

21/01/2019
---
Today I got offer from one of my colleagues on current project to join the another project he works on. I think I'll take it. I talk to my boss and he said it's ok for him. I'll probably know more details tomorrow.

22/01/2019
---
I felt really terrible today. I had a headache and couldn't focus on things I had to do. I went sleep at 9 pm... ;)

23/01/2019
---
That was a good day. I finally settled matters with my diploma thesis. I gave it to the dean's office. In work we're configuring cluster environment so I have to figure out how to deploy on it. That's interesting and challenging (I have never worked with cluster systems before).

24/01/2019
---
I finally finished one of my critical tasks today! The one drawback on this is that I can't test it until install on production. I see how (unit) tests gives a hidden power of not beeing afraid of modyfing etc. Sometimes I even feel guilty when I write a code and didn't write tests to it :D.

25/01/2019
---
I finally took a decision about new project. I'm on board. From the next week I'm starting to work on second project (the same client). I took it only for one reason: experience.

26/01/2019
---
Today was the last day of my studies. I think I have successfully completed my education (at least bachelor). I have to defend my diploma thesis and officially I'll be an engineer!

27/01/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. At the morning I've been at the church then afterwords I went on swimming pool. I relaxed myself and had conversation with a friend who's the lifeguard there.

28/01/2019
---
Monday.. I woke up at 5am, breakfast, work, workout, learning and sleep. In short it was all day. It was good. I think that at the end of the week I'll take some remote work so that I can concentrate more on learning to defend my diploma thesis.

29/01/2019
---
Lately I have terrible headaches while intense work. I hope it isn't anything serious. I'll work tomorrow with the pomodoro technique to see results.

30/01/2019
---
What a crazy day! I have some critical bug reports in our system and I don't know what causes it... Additionally I have to learn a lot to my diploma exam. One more news, I'll probably have to move out of the flat I'm currently renting 'cause my roommates are moving out.

31/01/2019

I was at the jsession today which is a group of the java developers. There was 2 talks. First about functional programming in Scala and the second one about profiling the applications. In my opinion the second one was better. It was presented by a deaveloper with 12 years experience that was talking on his life experience with profiling. 

01/02/2019

Friiiiday!! Start of the weekend :)! I was at the swimming pool with a couple of colleagues. It was a good time and I could relax. Besides, I have a lot of learning to my diploma exam. 

02/02/2019
---
Today I've been a procrastinating. I learned something for my diploma exam, but I know I could have done more. Anyway, rest is also very important so balance is the best option.

03/02/2019
---
What a laaazy Sunday. Buy, I wish we'll have a spring/summer right now. I just want to go outside, take off a shirt and get a sun!!

04/02/2019
---
And the Monday. Everything was good at work. When I got home I ate a dinner, which I took from home :D and I did a training. Then I studied to diploma exam and repeated my presentation. I have to present it 2 min faster (today it was 11 min).

05/02/2019
---
It's getting closer and closer to the final day of thesis exam. It's on Thursday. I think I'm ready to that. I've been learning a lot in last and current week. We'll see the result :)

06/02/2019
---
Work and study. This words describe my last days clearly. Tomorrow is a day of truth - will I be an engineer? Tomorrow I'll know that.

07/02/2019
---
I have it! 5 on my diploma exam :) and I'm super happy :D. From tomorrow I'm starting my first 25 days challenge - breath holding. It will last unti 5 of March and I'll update my best 'score' every week in readme file (just to see potential progress).

08/02/2019

I went on volleyball training and after warmup I decided it's not for me. I suck. I wasn't playing for 2 months and I literally suck. So after warmup I took my stuff and went on swimming pool which is next to the place where we had a training.

That was a good day. I've been so productive. First I finished exercises for chapter 7 of git course. Afterwards I created a shell script to auto commit and push and finally I was learning some English (I need someone to practice speaking altogether with me).

10/02/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. I was at the church, then we had a family dinner. I watched a ski jumping competition and drove to Bialystok. That's how the day looked like in a shortcut üòâ.

11/02/2019
---
Arghh.. We've got something incorrectly configured on our systems and one thing doesn't want to work. It took me the whole day to figure it and all I know for now is - it doesn't work. It's really bad when things like this happends especially when you have other tasks to do in this week.

12/02/2019
---
Yesterday's problem. Not solved. Anyway I'll create a ticket to support for help on that topic and I want to focus my attention on other tasks. I have a new task with some changes in the code. The code is 3-4 months old but it is already defined as legacy code. No tests and I want to improve this code better by entering tests for this code!

Today in the flat I rent the owners made some renovation. When I came back from work, they were still here painting the walls. I also have a new bed. Much more comfortable than the previous one :).

14/02/2019
---
It's almost the end of the week. Time flies by so fast ... Today I worked a little bit longer (officialy 8h in the office) and 3 hours at home because tomorrow we have a meeting about topic I didn't know very well. That's why I worked after hours to 'get in' the topic. Anyway tomorrow probably I'll finish 3 hours earlier :)

15/02/2019

Yooho! Friday :). With friends I was at the swimming pool and I ate strawberries today! It was yummy..

16/02/2019

I spent todays evening with my friends. We were sitting in their flat and we chatted about life and other stuff.

17/02/2019

Today, with family we had a little celebration day. It was my mom's birthday. It was a good time with family (and cake :D).

18/02/2019

I had to submit documents for studies, so I left work at 12 in the morning and went to university. When I submitted my master's degree papers, there were two levels of English to choose from: B2 + and C1. I do not feel up to level C1, but all B2 + slots have been filled, so I had to ... I'm not sure if this decision about studying is good, but we'll see :)

19/02/2019

Arghh!! I got angry so bad today! I had an appointment to a doctor at 10:45. I was in there right on time. I registered, there were a few people in front of me (like 5 or 6). Everything was fine until now. After 2 hours of waiting I couldn't take it anymore (I had a meeting at 1 PM) I asked what my position was in the queue.... I was 4th. I just took my papers and left.

20/02/2019
---
Ha!! I planned to go to the doctor on Thursday but I decided to back to my hometown today and ... I did papers for studies in 30 min instead of 2 hours of waiting in queue :)!

21/02/2019
---
Another good day :). I worked remotely today. I really like to work like this especially at the summer time when you can go outside and get some sun + do some work. Additionally I went on swimming pool (as always), had some chill time ... ;)

22/02/2019
---
Ye!! Friday :). I went on swimming pool with my cousin today, it was nice. There is also a new schedule for my master's studies, which doesn't look bad. I have a busy Monday and Tuesday, but other days looks good :)

23/02/2019
---
That was a good day! We had 'holiday' at our church. There was many people and friends. Afterwards with a group of friends we went to my aunt house and we were chatting :)

24/02/2019
---
I almost forgot to write today's note. Uff... I used this beautiful Sunday to meet my friends and be with family. :D

25/02/2019
---
What a day. Literally, I didn't have time to do anything. I went out at 10am and returned at 8pm. Mondays are gonna be tough.

26/02/2019
---
Today I had classes related to math... Aaaaa I'm scared a bit. I've always been terrible in math and I think it's not better now.

27/02/2019
---
And we're at the middle of the week. Today I had less classes so I could spend some time on my own things. In addition I ate a good lunch (vegetables and rice).

28/02/2019
---
That was the last day of February. Today I was at the jSession, which is java communicy meeting. There was 2 presentations - first about how to not make our code legacy and the second one about AWS and serverless. Meetings like that are a great occassion to meet new people.

01/03/2019

Friday and the new month. Sounds great! :). I did back to my hometown and went to the swimming pool with my cousins. Arghh! And one more thing. My car broke down, luckily after returning home. I don't know much about car mechanics, so tomorrow with my dad we'll see together what happened there.

02/03/2019

I spent the day at home. I had fun with my brother's son :). Unfortunately, the problem with the car is serious and I have to give it to the mechanic.
