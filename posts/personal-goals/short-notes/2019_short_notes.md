First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

02/01/2019
---
Today I did a workout üí™üí™ and went to the swimming pool üèä. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time. 

03/01/2019
---
What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

04/01/2019
---
Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

05/01/2019
---
5th day of 2019 officialy ended. Today I coocked a really tasty meal! Chicken with rice (sounds normal, but it was SUPER good). Tomorrow I'll add some vegetables (especially broccoli) to this. I like cooking! üî™üëç

06/01/2019
---
I forgot about this completely! It's a day after and I realized I didn't write anything here. Shame on me!

07/01/2019
---
Totday was 1st real work day in this year. We had a meeting with summary of what is left to do. I was also celebrating 2nd Christmas (Orthodox) with family. Here, where I live, we're celebrating everything :D.

08/01/2019
---
First day in the office in this year. I've not been in the office since almost 3 weeks! It's good to be back in here :)

09/01/2019
---
It was a good day. In work all is on a good road. The only thing I missing is knowledge :D. I need to learn more and learn harder to be a better developer!!

10/01/2019
---
Today after back from work I ate dinner and with roommates we started cleaning our flat. It took us almost 3 hours to clean it all. I feel proud of us because we were planning that since few months but noone wasn't to take an action and today - we all took!

11/01/2019
---
Today 2 of my friends came to our flat. They have studies this weekend and that's the reason why. It was a fun evening :).

12/01/2019
---
I had my thesis presentation on seminar at studies. It is always kind of stressfull when I have to present something in front of a people. But I did it and the result is that I have to prepare better and cut the duration. 

13/01/2019
---
Sunday. I ate dinner with my family at my parents. It is always good to spend time with your family. I love them and it is really important for everyone to respect family and find time for them!

14/01/2019
---
Our production server was down the whole day. I had a time to learn something new and to focus a little bit on my stuff.

15/01/2019
---
It was a pretty tough day! I got off from work a little bit earlier because I had to do some papers to school. But after returning to home I had few emails about new tasks. Beside of that I had to make some project on studies with my colleague. A lot of things to do and the day is only 24h :D.

16/01/2019
---
Studying, studying, studying... Lately there is a lot of this. My day very often looks like this: work > dinner after work > workout > studying. But to be honest, I like to study :)

17/01/2019
---
Today in work we had a meeting about future and the current state of our project. In the end of the March we'll have a final decision if project go further or fails. Beside of that it was a good day! üëçüëç

18/01/2019
---
I had awesome day! And honestly, I don't know why... I had the feeling of coming spring and I LOVE it. I really want it to be spring now! Today I also came back to my hometown for a weekend :)

19/01/2019
---
I slept 10 hours and I don't feel bad about it. I know that my body sometimes needs a longer rest and if I can do it, I do it.

20/01/2019
---
Today after dinner I came back to Bialystok (the place where I work). To be honest, I don't know how long I'll stay here (I mean in the flat I currently living) because my roommate is moving out and we had a good relationships.

21/01/2019
---
Today I got offer from one of my colleagues on current project to join the another project he works on. I think I'll take it. I talk to my boss and he said it's ok for him. I'll probably know more details tomorrow.

22/01/2019
---
I felt really terrible today. I had a headache and couldn't focus on things I had to do. I went sleep at 9 pm... ;)

23/01/2019
---
That was a good day. I finally settled matters with my diploma thesis. I gave it to the dean's office. In work we're configuring cluster environment so I have to figure out how to deploy on it. That's interesting and challenging (I have never worked with cluster systems before).

24/01/2019
---
I finally finished one of my critical tasks today! The one drawback on this is that I can't test it until install on production. I see how (unit) tests gives a hidden power of not beeing afraid of modyfing etc. Sometimes I even feel guilty when I write a code and didn't write tests to it :D.

25/01/2019
---
I finally took a decision about new project. I'm on board. From the next week I'm starting to work on second project (the same client). I took it only for one reason: experience.

26/01/2019
---
Today was the last day of my studies. I think I have successfully completed my education (at least bachelor). I have to defend my diploma thesis and officially I'll be an engineer!

27/01/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. At the morning I've been at the church then afterwords I went on swimming pool. I relaxed myself and had conversation with a friend who's the lifeguard there.

28/01/2019
---
Monday.. I woke up at 5am, breakfast, work, workout, learning and sleep. In short it was all day. It was good. I think that at the end of the week I'll take some remote work so that I can concentrate more on learning to defend my diploma thesis.

29/01/2019
---
Lately I have terrible headaches while intense work. I hope it isn't anything serious. I'll work tomorrow with the pomodoro technique to see results.

30/01/2019
---
What a crazy day! I have some critical bug reports in our system and I don't know what causes it... Additionally I have to learn a lot to my diploma exam. One more news, I'll probably have to move out of the flat I'm currently renting 'cause my roommates are moving out.

31/01/2019
---
I was at the jsession today which is a group of the java developers. There was 2 talks. First about functional programming in Scala and the second one about profiling the applications. In my opinion the second one was better. It was presented by a deaveloper with 12 years experience that was talking on his life experience with profiling. 

01/02/2019
---
Friiiiday!! Start of the weekend :)! I was at the swimming pool with a couple of colleagues. It was a good time and I could relax. Besides, I have a lot of learning to my diploma exam. 

02/02/2019
---
Today I've been a procrastinating. I learned something for my diploma exam, but I know I could have done more. Anyway, rest is also very important so balance is the best option.

03/02/2019
---
What a laaazy Sunday. Buy, I wish we'll have a spring/summer right now. I just want to go outside, take off a shirt and get a sun!!

04/02/2019
---
And the Monday. Everything was good at work. When I got home I ate a dinner, which I took from home :D and I did a training. Then I studied to diploma exam and repeated my presentation. I have to present it 2 min faster (today it was 11 min).

05/02/2019
---
It's getting closer and closer to the final day of thesis exam. It's on Thursday. I think I'm ready to that. I've been learning a lot in last and current week. We'll see the result :)

06/02/2019
---
Work and study. This words describe my last days clearly. Tomorrow is a day of truth - will I be an engineer? Tomorrow I'll know that.

07/02/2019
---
I have it! 5 on my diploma exam :) and I'm super happy :D. From tomorrow I'm starting my first 25 days challenge - breath holding. It will last unti 5 of March and I'll update my best 'score' every week in readme file (just to see potential progress).

08/02/2019
---
I went on volleyball training and after warmup I decided it's not for me. I suck. I wasn't playing for 2 months and I literally suck. So after warmup I took my stuff and went on swimming pool which is next to the place where we had a training.

09/02/2019

That was a good day. I've been so productive. First I finished exercises for chapter 7 of git course. Afterwards I created a shell script to auto commit and push and finally I was learning some English (I need someone to practice speaking altogether with me).

10/02/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. I was at the church, then we had a family dinner. I watched a ski jumping competition and drove to Bialystok. That's how the day looked like in a shortcut üòâ.

11/02/2019
---
Arghh.. We've got something incorrectly configured on our systems and one thing doesn't want to work. It took me the whole day to figure it and all I know for now is - it doesn't work. It's really bad when things like this happends especially when you have other tasks to do in this week.

12/02/2019
---
Yesterday's problem. Not solved. Anyway I'll create a ticket to support for help on that topic and I want to focus my attention on other tasks. I have a new task with some changes in the code. The code is 3-4 months old but it is already defined as legacy code. No tests and I want to improve this code better by entering tests for this code!

13/02/2019
---
Today in the flat I rent the owners made some renovation. When I came back from work, they were still here painting the walls. I also have a new bed. Much more comfortable than the previous one :).

14/02/2019
---
It's almost the end of the week. Time flies by so fast ... Today I worked a little bit longer (officialy 8h in the office) and 3 hours at home because tomorrow we have a meeting about topic I didn't know very well. That's why I worked after hours to 'get in' the topic. Anyway tomorrow probably I'll finish 3 hours earlier :)

15/02/2019
---
Yooho! Friday :). With friends I was at the swimming pool and I ate strawberries today! It was yummy..

16/02/2019
---
I spent todays evening with my friends. We were sitting in their flat and we chatted about life and other stuff.

17/02/2019
---
Today, with family we had a little celebration day. It was my mom's birthday. It was a good time with family (and cake :D).

18/02/2019
---
I had to submit documents for studies, so I left work at 12 in the morning and went to university. When I submitted my master's degree papers, there were two levels of English to choose from: B2 + and C1. I do not feel up to level C1, but all B2 + slots have been filled, so I had to ... I'm not sure if this decision about studying is good, but we'll see :)

19/02/2019
---
Arghh!! I got angry so bad today! I had an appointment to a doctor at 10:45. I was in there right on time. I registered, there were a few people in front of me (like 5 or 6). Everything was fine until now. After 2 hours of waiting I couldn't take it anymore (I had a meeting at 1 PM) I asked what my position was in the queue.... I was 4th. I just took my papers and left.

20/02/2019
---
Ha!! I planned to go to the doctor on Thursday but I decided to back to my hometown today and ... I did papers for studies in 30 min instead of 2 hours of waiting in queue :)!

21/02/2019
---
Another good day :). I worked remotely today. I really like to work like this especially at the summer time when you can go outside and get some sun + do some work. Additionally I went on swimming pool (as always), had some chill time ... ;)

22/02/2019
---
Ye!! Friday :). I went on swimming pool with my cousin today, it was nice. There is also a new schedule for my master's studies, which doesn't look bad. I have a busy Monday and Tuesday, but other days looks good :)

23/02/2019
---
That was a good day! We had 'holiday' at our church. There was many people and friends. Afterwards with a group of friends we went to my aunt house and we were chatting :)

24/02/2019
---
I almost forgot to write today's note. Uff... I used this beautiful Sunday to meet my friends and be with family. :D

25/02/2019
---
What a day. Literally, I didn't have time to do anything. I went out at 10am and returned at 8pm. Mondays are gonna be tough.

26/02/2019
---
Today I had classes related to math... Aaaaa I'm scared a bit. I've always been terrible in math and I think it's not better now.

27/02/2019
---
And we're at the middle of the week. Today I had less classes so I could spend some time on my own things. In addition I ate a good lunch (vegetables and rice).

28/02/2019
---
That was the last day of February. Today I was at the jSession, which is java communicy meeting. There was 2 presentations - first about how to not make our code legacy and the second one about AWS and serverless. Meetings like that are a great occassion to meet new people.

01/03/2019
---
Friday and the new month. Sounds great! :). I did back to my hometown and went to the swimming pool with my cousins. Arghh! And one more thing. My car broke down, luckily after returning home. I don't know much about car mechanics, so tomorrow with my dad we'll see together what happened there.

02/03/2019
---
I spent the day at home. I had fun with my brother's son :). Unfortunately, the problem with the car is serious and I have to give it to the mechanic.

03/03/2019
---
It was regular Sunday. I went to church and then we had a family dinner. In the evening I went to the city where I work (I borrowed a car from my parents).

04/03/2019
---
Monday.. Actually, I like Mondays. It's not always easy to handle a new week, but when you have a good approach, you can do it. I can do it for sure (ofc. sometimes there are bad moments but this is rare). 

05/03/2019
---
This is the last day of my breath hold challenge! I found it very usefull, but unfortunately I don't have time for it (even if it takes 20 minutes a day). I'm glad that recently I don't have so many tasks at work so I can focus more on my studying.

06/03/2019
---
That was interesting day. Ofc. a lot of studying, but today it was something different. I was creating very simple app in react-native. First I had to configure to make it work altogether with Java 11, which took me a while. At the late afternoon I got an email with a job offer which is quite interesting... I'm already on 2 projects so we'll see where this whole situation will go.

07/03/2019
---
What a day! Until afternoon everything was going smoothly. And at one moment, EMAIL, EMAIL, EMAIL... that was overwhelming. Thanks God, I manage to prioritize the tasks that came and I solved them one by one. Well, not exactly all of them but at least I'm at good starting point for tomorrow continuation ;)

08/03/2019
---
Today I had a job interview with a HR recruiter. We talked on the phone for an hour and on next Wednesday I have technical interview. If I succeed I'll have a lot of work to do... But we'll see after Wednesday :)  

09/03/2019
---
I wanted to learn math today, but I was preparing myself for job interview. I also met with my friends and went to a hairdresser (which is actually my friend). And ofc. I went to the pool :)

10/03/2019
---
I always try to be positive but what happend today.... makes me RAGE! Our new roommate has invited some of his 'friends' BUT these weren't normal people (I'm sorry to say this), they were bums who stink terribly and what is worse THEY STAY FOR A NIGHT! It's 100% certain that tomorrow I'm calling the owner of the aparment to talk about it. And it's me or him. Someone has to leave.

11/03/2019
---
When I woke up I was still angry. I called owner of our flat and described the situation. She wasn't happy (in warm words). Fortunatelly situation is established right now and hopefully it won't ever happen again.

12/03/2019
---
It was a very ordinary day. Work -> School -> Work -> Studying. In the end, our new roommate didn't cause problems in the evening but anyway we need to get rid of him (we don't trust him and we can't lock our rooms).

13/03/2019
---
I had technical job interview today. It was very interesting. The guy, who had conversation with me asked me a lot of questions where I had to think instead of know something. I don't know if they'll offer me job after this talk but still, it was very nice talk.

14/03/2019
---
Hi! It was a good day. I had better in my life but it was fine :). I'm thinking of find new flat to rent 'cause I'm tired of living here with that new roommate and actually I'm kind of scared of him.

15/03/2019
---
I got sick :(. The whole day I felt terrible and I went sleep at 5 pm..

16/03/2019
---
Wow! I slept 14 hours!! And what is most important I felt good today :). I'm not sick anymore. Today I met with my friends and also went on swimming pool.

17/03/2019
---
Today I celebrated friend birthday üéÇ! It was a good Sunday with beautiful weather. I wish spring to come faster :)

18/03/2019
---
Another really weird day!!! My roommate (not the new one) went CRAZY! He wanted to commit suicide... He left a farewell letter etc.. I lost all afternoon and evening dealing with the police and so on.I also told our owner of the aparment that I'm leaving and I don't want to live there anymore. She totally understood this. Ultimately, the roommate was found and is safe.

19/03/2019
---
It was a good day. At the evening we met with few friends on pizza. Good and fun time. I needed that :)

20/03/2019
---
I finished things related to renting an apartment. I paid (a lot) for the last 2 months and gave the keys to the owner.

21/03/2019
---
Bum! My job offer was rejected. They say that they need someone more experienced and I can try again in 4-6 months. I have to learn more and start sharing my knowledge :)

22/03/2019
---
Yuuhuuu! Friday :). I'm thinking of starting some new project where I can use Spring, Hibernate, Angular etc.. In general new technologies... I really don't want to have any technical debt. I have to find problem which is interesting to me so I'll be motivated and have fun.

23/03/2019
---
It was beautiful Saturday! Sun was shining and the weather was perfect. Life is wonderful! We have to remember this :)

24/03/2019
---
Today was my grandma's birthday. All family met up altogether to celebrate. We had a typical village dinner. It was a good time. Afterwards 'young' generation moved to another party (including me). Also.. great time with friends :)

25/03/2019
---
Monday! I like Mondays :). It was very casual. First work, then school and finally relax - swimming pool with friends.

26/03/2019
---
Today I had a short conversation with IT recruiter from Great Britain. It's a nice experience to talk about job and opportunities in language other than native. He offered me job in Warsaw. I agreed on technical interview but anyway if they won't offer me remote work I think I'll reject this offer.

27/03/2019
---
Very simple day. At the morning I drove to Bialystok on the University. At noon I went to the office and after work (around 3:30 PM) I drove back home. At home I was studying :)

28/03/2019
---
Today I read a lot about Docker and Collections in Java. I also practice some things in Docker (docker's classroom). At the evening I went out on swimming pool with cousin. We were chatting and chilling :) 

29/03/2019
---
Time flies by so fast... Sometimes I would like to stop him, sit down and do nothing. I'll do it in May, on my birthday. I'll sit and watch the sunset without worrying about anything!

30/03/2019
---
The running season is officialy started! Today, I ran 4.5km with an average pace (5:00/km). I felt so good after running. The weather was PERFECT. It was a beautiful sunset. And all the nature in the heart of the forest! There are no words to describe this view :)

31/03/2019
---
Last day of March! Time going so fast.. Today I resigned from meeting friends. Instead I was learning for classes for upcoming week. I'm not sure if it was best choice but it's already history :)

01/04/2019
---
April!! The day was fine. Nothing special happend. Tomorrow I have another job interview (phone call). I don't have big hopes for that. It's more to know where I am and what is market looking for at this moment. 

02/04/2019
---
Today I had another technical interview. It was a conversation over the phone. Generally, my impressions are good. I know what my weaknesses are (Spring, more advanced things). I also know my strengths. It's time for learning! Work hard now, it'll pay off later :) 

03/04/2019
---
Another wonderful day :). I have a lot of tasks to-do in work. I know I'll do them well if God will bless me! In life, it is really important to be thankfull for what we have and don't complain!! I have food, clothes, car and some money in the pocket. You know what?? I'm rich! :)

04/04/2019
---
Uff... Long day. I worked really hard today. I took a break for workout and lunch. It was necessary, otherwise my brain would explode. In the evening I went to the swimming pool with a few friends. We had a funny time.. :)

05/04/2019
---
Once again in was really tough Friday. I had a lot of work. Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed and to be honest I would like to forget about all things related to work and go anywhere... I love what I do, but sometimes it's HARD... especially when you work with old technologies :(

06/04/2019
---
It was beautiful weather outside today!! I really love it. I played with the Docker today. I created Tomcat server image, configured few things and so on. Docker is really powerful!

07/04/2019
---
This Sunday was strange. Most of my friends went out somewhere, so we couldn't meet up. I decided to spent the Sunday at home. I had some work to do. I started my job stuff at 3 pm and I finished at 10 pm! I didn't feel that time, it was really strange.

08/04/2019
---
Today I'll share some of my thoughts. Self-discipline is very important in life. Thanks to her, we can stick to our plans, grow up (mentally and physically) and we're trustworthy! First of all - we don't lie to ourselves. For example: you tell yourself that you will go to the gym at least 3 times a week. And you did only for 2 weeks... You lied yourself! Don't do this! Stick to your plans. And what is important - have a plan!

09/04/2019
---
I don't know why but I hate English classes on my studies. My goal for 2019 is to learn English in more advanced level but I hate do that at the University. Is it something wrong with me?

10/04/2019
---
It was a good day. I wrote simple app in react-native that uses devices sensors. I slept approximately 1 hour during the day. I went on swimming pool with my cousin. Yeahh... definitely a good day ;)

11/04/2019
---
I spent all day at home. Tomorrow I have a meeting with the team where we'll discuss what to implement and how. This is very important especially to me, because I'm the main developer in the project. I've prepared the short presentation which covers what we want to achieve and what is unclear.

12/04/2019
---
As I wrote yesterday, today we had a meeting with the team to discuss new feature. It went well. It wasn't said clearly but we'll (me especially) work in scrum. In next 2 weeks I have to show what is done and what is stil missing. I like that idea :)

13/04/2019
---
I think it's a really good routine that I write here every day. What if I didn't do it? Well.. I think my English would be on a lower level. I really like doing it!

14/04/2019
---
What a great Sunday! We celebrated our uncle's 45th birthday with all our family. It was an amazing time :)

15/04/2019
---
Today I've been on swimming pool with my friends. Really cool time. We chatted and had fun :).

16/04/2019
---
To be honest I don't know what to say for today. It's already the next day and I'm sitting in front of the window. It's a beautiful morning outside. I love this view..

17/04/2019
---
Today I finally ran 5 km. The time was good - 4:55min/km. I felt tired after the run and I know that my condition is not in the right place yet. However, I have time to overcome another goal for 2019 (run 5km below 22min) and while training more, I'm closer to this goal!

18/04/2019
---
This week I have a lot of work to do in both projects. In addition I have studies and of course there are homework there. I know that if God helps me and gives me wisdom to understand everything, it'll be easy!

19/04/2019
---
It's beautifull weather outside. In the morning I ran 4km with decent pace. Afterwards I worked during whole day. In the meantime I was tanning and I did a workout. In the evening I went on swimming pool with my cousins.

20/04/2019
---
I tried to write application for studies today but I didn't felt very productive.. I just made some fun with docker and tomcat server. I've found out that tomcat actually is not really EE server, it's just container for servlets. It's good to know :)

21/04/2019
---
Easter time :). What is most important about this holiday is that Jesus Christ died and after three days got alive. For all the people on the world. Keep that in mind and thanks the Lord everyday for everything He's giving you.

22/04/2019
---
It was a great Monday. In the morning with the whole family we went to church. Then we had a familly dinner. Afterwards I went to my friends. We were chatting and had a really good time. That's what I was missing lately - to stop and enjoy life üñêüñê

23/04/2019
---
The first day at work after Easter. I put on a little bit and these are not muscles :( I think I have to start going to the gym to build muscle mass instead of being slim. I like to run but it burns my muscles instead of building them.

24/04/2019
---
Today I went to see a new flat, which I bought with my parents. There was not the first stunning impression, but I appreciate it and I think it is nice.

25/04/2019
---
It was long day. I have important task to do with deadline to Monday, so I worked veeery long today. Weather outside is BEAUTIFUL, everything blooms. Tomorrow I'll use the weather and I'll work outstide! 

26/04/2019
---
Today was summer. 27 degrees outside. I decided to work in the backyard and it was a great decision. I literally love the weather like today!!!üòçüòç

27/04/2019
---
It was another good day. Again - the weather was perfect. I'm grateful to God for everything he gives... even small things like the weather üôÇüôÇ

28/04/2019
---
Today we celebrated easter once again! :). It was a good time spent together with friends. The weather wasn't as sunny as a few days earlier but it was nice anyway.

Monday... It was another good Monday! üòä. Since my morning habits are everyday, almost every Monday is good, especially when I wake up and see the glowing sun. Today at work I had a little demo preview. We talked with the product owner and one guy on the client's side.Everything went well, they are satisfied and I'm also happy with the work I have done. üëä

Last day of April. Whaaat?! I said that few times here but I'll say it again - time flies by so fast.

01/05/2019
---
Today I was helping my dad at work in the yard. It's good to do some physical work from time to time instead of clicking on the keyboard üòÑüòÑ 

02/05/2019
---
I spent the whole day at home. In the evening I went out to buy some food and that's all. I worked on projects for studies that are quite interesting and certainly educate - this is what studies are for üòÉ


03/05/2019
---
It was a funny day. In the late afternoon I went out on swimming pool with couple of friends and we met other friends there. Finally we finished our evening together on grill üëçüëç


04/05/2019
---
Today was my birthday. I spent 25 years on this Earth, thanks God I'm all healthy and actually have everything I want/need to have.

05/05/2019

Birthdays after birthdays... Today we celebrated my nephew birthday. He's one and so adorable. I really love him and when I look at him sometimes I think I want kid too üòÖ

08/05/2019
---
Hahaa! I just noticed that I lost few days in my titles. I wanted to type 06/05 and then I realized - HEY DUDE! IT WAS A FEW DAYS AGO! To be honest I have no idea when I forgot to write something because all the time for over few months I didn't look at the date in computer but always on date in previous title.

09/05/2019
---
What a great day. Of course I worked a lot (7am-6pm) but if you really like your job you don't feel bad about it. I really like my work (maybe even love) and it's a pleasure (though not always). However, after work I went out with friends. First we went to the swimming pool and then eat some fast food. It was a good time üëäüëä

10/05/2019
---
Long Friday. I didn't do anything super interesting. It was a very ordinary day. Work, training, some shopping, tv series and sleep.

11/05/2019
---
Wedding day!! Today I celebrated my friends wedding. It was really cool - many friends, good food. I talked a lot and had a good time üëçüëç

12/05/2019
---
I have no idea what happened to me today but I was miserable and very unproductive. I slept a lot during the day and felt alone. It wasn't good day to me..

13/05/2019
---
It was a good day. If I compare it to yesterday then it's even PERFECT day haha :D. It was very ordinal, work, studies...

14/05/2019
---
I was so tired after this day... I worked the whole day and one more additional thing... In my new apartment there is a fan in the kitchen and when it's windy otustide this fan all the time produces weird noises. It drives me totally crazy!!

15/05/2019
---
Home sweet home.. I'm back in my hometown again (after 3 days absence :D). It's always good to be here. Today at the swimming pool I realized that I'm fat or bigger than I expected! üò™üò™ I need to do something with that!

16/05/2019
---
What a great day! Today I choose very wisely - what does it mean?! Well... I went out with my friends. First, we went on the swimming pool and then to the house of one of our friends. It was blessed time. Honestly, I had doubts - go home, eat something healthy and  work or go with friends, eat a pizza and talk. I chose the latter option and I don't regret my decision üòâüòâ

17/05/2019
---
Ahh! Today we had beautiful weather. It's shocking that in May this is like 3rd day with such weather. The other days are usually cloudy, windy or cold... I went for running to the forest today and it's wonderful there. Everything grows up and comes to life.. 

18/05/2019
---
It was a good day. I spent it at home, doing homework for studies and watching League of Legends. In the evening I went to run and ran 3km :)

19/05/2019
---
Another wonderful day! Today, with friends we celebrated the birthday of one of our friends. The funniest thing is that the weather stations said it would rain, but ultimately it was a beautiful day :)

20/05/2019
---
It was tough day. In the morning I deployed a new version of our product and it had bugs!! So I literally spent the whole day to fix it. And between that time I still had to be at the university.

21/05/2019
---
Hmm... What can I say about today?! I don't know - this is very popular answer and I use it very often, too often... I have to be more creative and more inspiring. I have no idea how, but I know I have to start doing somthing into this. Taking first step is always difficult..üòè 

22/05/2019
---
Continuing yesterday's thoughts.. Storytelling is a really creative task. If you want to tell your story in an interesting way... This is a task I want to learn.üëäüëä

23/05/2019
---
It was a great day! First - I solved many issues from our JIRA. There wasn't much code to write there, it was more like analyzing and rewriting a few lines of code. Then I had a good workout - my goal is to do at least 3 workouts a week and it was the second. And finally, in the evening I went out with my friends. We went on the swimming pool and had fun üëçüëç

24/05/2019
---
I'm siting on my chair and I don't know what to write. It was normal day. Oo! I know! Tomorrow in our church we have a conference. I hope there'll be some new people to meet and that God will bless that time.

25/05/2019
---
Today - as I mentioned yesterday - we had a conference in our church. There was a lot of people. I met a few new people and spent time with those I already knew. It was a good time üòâüòâ

26/05/2019
---
It was one of the best Sunday's in my entire life. I finally understood what life is really about. I want to have this energy and motivation! For everyone who look for the answer what is the most important in our life - it's not money, job or even family. It's God and we should be focused to serve him as much as we can!

27/05/2019

I was at the dentist today to get rid of wisdom teeth. It was the first visit, so the doctor only carried out an inspection and planned the date of the operation. And you know what? The first available date is April 2020 üòÑüòÑ. I took it :D.

28/05/2019
---
It was a productive day. I talked to my boss, I actually wrote about the promotion and we arranged a meeting for the next week. I solved one major task and came up with the idea of how to finish the next one. I also decided to go to 'SlƒÖsk' and confirmed this decision to my cousin. For now and forever - STOP wasting time :)

29/05/2019
---
Another wonderful day! My friend invited me to the grill and I agreed. It was so cool and chill. There was around 15 people, we were chatting and so on. I had really, really good fun! üòÄüòÄ

30/05/2019
---
It was another beautiful day. Well... in the morning I received bad information - my work colleague got sick - and I have to take all of her responsibilities. Anyway, the whole day was ideal. Our German colleagues had a national holiday so noone was interrupting my work.üòÖüòÖ

31/05/2019
---
Just few sentences about today. It wasn't an easy day. As I mentioned yesterday, I went to the western side of Poland - Silesia. This means I had 7h of travel. And when it comes to work... I was creating parser and after 4h of work I realized that it isn't easy task. Maybe it's not even possible :(

01/06/2019
---
It's June! This day was really good. We had a good time here (in Silesia). I have seen and have had a short conversation with many members of my family and I am generally happy that I am here :)

02/06/2019
---
Another wonderful day :) We were in the church and it was blessing time! Today we also drove back to our eastern side of Poland. Thank God we arrived without any problems.

03/06/2019
---
Today I had to work overhours. This is because tomorrow we have key users training and someone (me) had to prepare system. üòé

04/06/2019
---
It was another great day. It's very hot in Poland - it looks like the summer has come to us :). That's good! I can't wait to get back to my hometown and sunbathe.

05/06/2019
---
Today I had a periodic conversation with my boss. It's really useful to have this talk at least once a year. In the evening I went out with friends and had a pleasant evening.

06/06/2019
---
Finally in hometown ... ;) I want to enjoy the weather outside!! Today with my roommate (we're renting a room for our friend) I ran 3km. The pace on last kilometer was my best in 2019!üí™üí™

07/06/2019
---
Today I realized that I have a lot of work on my studies - 2 individual projects, 1 group project and 1 math exam. The last one will probably take most of my time and energy. I really want to create interesting projects, but because I don't have time I'm afraid it will be medium.

08/06/2019
---
It was a very productive day! I was studying math and doing project for studies in react native. In the evening I went out for a bike with my cousin. The weather outside is great! I really love and appreciate days like this! Thanks GOD for that!!!üòäüòä

09/06/2019
---
Very sunny Sunday. However I'm not entirely happy how I spent it. I didn't visit anyone. I were sitting home all day and studying. :(

10/06/2019
---
Mo mo Monday. I'm grateful for this day! Today I went to Bialystok and unfortunately I was stuck in traffic. It was caused by a car accident and the road was closed for 40 minutes. Well.. nobody died and it was good to stand there and do nothing :)

11/06/2019
---
Ehh!! I don't think I can learn math in 2 days! :(. This is my mistake, I should start this at least a month ago... Well, hope is still alive, the first attempt is on Thursday, the second for 2 weeks. If God help me everything is possible.üí™üí™

12/06/2019
---
I decided to not to go to the office today. Instead I stayed at home and the whole day I was learning math! After all day my hand is sore!! I hope, God will help me on exam üôè

13/06/2019
---
Today was the day of truth - do I know enough to pass exam? The answer is 'I don't know', haha üòÖ. It wasn't tough. If I started to learn a few days earlier I could pass it without a problem. But I didn't do it and now I'm not sure if I have solved the tasks correctly and whether I'll pass in the first attempt.

14/06/2019
---
Wonderful day :). Everything is green, I mean all the trees, grass.. Thanks God for all the creation!

15/06/2019
---
It was a nice Saturday. In the morning I went out for run and ran 3 km. Then I was studying, did a workout and finally went to the bike with my friend in the evening üí™üí™. There is BEAUTIFUL weather outside and I want to use it 100%!!!

16/06/2019
---
Ehh üò•. I didn't pass math exam in the first attempt. I'm really curious what mistakes I made. Well.. the good point is that I have still over a week to study and that I know what to expect but still it would be much better if I pass it in the first attempt.

17/06/2019
---
Monday Monday Monday.. I love Mondays üòÑ. Today I almost finished this semester - the only thing that left is math exam. 

18/06/2019
---
I ran 3 km today with good pace. If I want to achieve my goal to run 5km under 22 minutes I have to start running longest distances, otherwise I won't complete it.

19/06/2019
---
Today I went on a bike with my cousin. We had interesting conversations about life and business. I think that my goal for 2020 will be something related to my own business. Even if it fails, I want to at least try.

20/06/2019
---
Another beautiful day! Today we had national holiday in Poland so it was non-working day. And yes - I didn't write any line of code but instead of that I wrote a lot of math exercises on paper. 

21/06/2019
---
Yoo hoo, Friday! One more tough week left. In next Thursday I have last exam (I guess) and this semester studying will be finally off!

22/06/2019
---
I spent this Saturday lonely. Only me and math.. I really want to pass this exam and finally have few days of relief...

23/06/2019
---
Sunday!! I was in the church celebrating baptism. You know.. I have other profession of faith - Pentecostal, and in our faith we don't baptize children. Anyway.. after all there was a big lunch for everyone, cake, games and good positive atmosphere!

24/06/2019
---
Pam pam pam.. Monday :)! It's a new week, which means new challenges. The biggest challenge for me this week is to pass my math exam! I was studying a lot for the last 2 weeks and I hope that God will give me a wisdom to do it.

25/06/2019
---
Today I had another great run! Last time I beat my personal record on 3 km's (12:28) and today it was 12:55 - which is also a great result for me!

26/06/2019
---
Ulala! I was informed that tomorrow I'll get new laptop! That's good news :). I have to prepare all the data for migrations! And tomorrow I have math exam!!

27/06/2019
---
Crazy day... I had this math exam and again I'm not 100% sure if I pass it. I mean I wrote a lot, but... who knows if it was correct? :D. Anyway... I got new laptop!! Yu huu! It's really cool! 

28/06/2019
---
End of the working week.. Today I visited my friend and he cut my hair (yeahh... that's my private hairdresser :D). Well...I don't know what else I can say. I'm waiting for the results from the math exam. It should be announced on Monday.

29/06/2019
---
Nice Saturday! Finally I had free time!!!! I could do whatever I wanted! And I did :). First I cleaned up my room, then helped a little in the 'Strongbox' open source project - I configured the project to work with Java 9. Late in the afternoon I went for a short nap and finally visited my friends in the evening! It's great to have so much time! :)

30/06/2019
---
Last day of June. Wow! Half of the year is already gone!! Question is: what did I do in this time? Well.. I know what I did because everything is tracked down here and how about you? üòÑ.

01/07/2019
---
Monday :) I like Mondays üëç. I have task at work which isn't specified in 100% - I mean it's unclear how it should be implemented. But I have to do it somehow... I don't like when something is not precisely told, but at least I'm getting some new experience in 'unclear' area üòÇüòÇ

02/07/2019
---
I went to the office today. I had to return the external drive I took last week. It's always a bit of a wasted time - 2 hours on the go but I had to... The upside is that during the driving I listen to podcasts ;)

03/07/2019
---
Mid of the week üòé. Weather in Poland have definitely changed out. It's 20 Celsius degrees and very windy outside. I don't like this!

04/07/2019
---
I did it! I beat my 5km record with stunning result - 21:31!! WoW! I remember few months ago when I was running and telling myself 'dude, 5km under 22 minutes is impossible'... well, with God's help everything is possible!

05/07/2019
---
Wedding day! Yuhuuu! Friends of mine got married :). It was amazing wedding! A lot of friends, good food, and fun fun fun :)!

06/07/2019
---
Today I had a lot of activities. I woke up at 9am. At 10:30 I went on bike with my cousin. It took 2 hours. Then at 1 PM. we went to the 'day after wedding party'. There was grill, volleyball, a lot of friends, etc. In general, we spent time together... Awesome day ;)

07/07/2019
---
Another Sunday has passed... Since a week the weather in Poland is awful and the forecasts are not promising for the next week :(. Unfortunately my vacation starts tomorrow :D ... life üòÖüòÖ  

08/07/2019
---
Today I realized how impatient I am. I should work on it. Btw. Monday and the first day of my 2 week holiday - it's very cold and windy outside.üò™

09/07/2019
---
I decided that I'm not going to Kopanica. This's a Christian camp that we went to almost every year... This year it's too cold and I have many other things to do.

10/07/2019
---
I got sick! :( What a pity... I think that the list of things to do this week overwhelmed me, as a result of which I fell ill. In addition, the weather is (in warm words) not cool and I can't go on a bike or running üò•

11/07/2019
---
Another day I'm sick :( I felt terrible today, I slept in more than two hours during the day and I was freezing ... Now that I'm writing, it's a lot better üëçüëç

12/07/2019
---
YES! Finally the weather is slightly better üëç. I felt much better today - I mowed the lawn and did 15km by a bike. I need nice weather to be active üòÖüòÖ

13/07/2019
---
Another day with wonderful weather üòä. I was sunbathing on the yard and enjoying this day :)

14/07/2019
---
Sunday ... :) I played in a volleyball today. We had barbecue and fun üòâüòâ

15/07/2019
---
It's a year since I write daily notes regularly. Lately I'm thinking about VLOGing also. That's very hard to overcome that fear of not beeing anonymous on the Internet. You know... you have to show your face to the others and get used to camera.. But who knows.. maybe in the future üòè

16/07/2019
---
Ehh!!! AGAIN the weather is crap! I hate that.. I think I took my vacations in worst possible time if we talk about weather.

17/07/2019
---
Today I had technical job interview talk. I have really big technical debt... And I know in current job there is no future :/. Company itself is great, boss is great but projects or maybe technologies used in that projects are crap üò•.

18/07/2019
---
That was a good day :). I finally sat down and started to record youtube tutorial on image processing. Procrastination is my great enemy. I need to learn how to fight it... Actually I know, I have to act instead of looking for other activities üòè

19/07/2019
---
I feel amazing üòä. After almost 2 weeks of procrastinations with recording a video tutorial I finally did it! Yes, it's not perfect and I don't have the feeling that thousands of people will watch it. Anyway, I fought with myself and won üëäüëè

20/07/2019
---
Another wonderful day... especially the evening :). It was a normal Saturday but in the late afternoon my friend invited me to his home. I rejected his offer, so he offered to come to me. I agreed. We had a great evening. We talked and it was really nice time. Ahh.. and the weather was perfect üòä

21/07/2019
---
Ohh... I realized I forgot to write something about Sunday... It's Tuesday morning already and what I remember I spent good time with friends on Sunday. We played volleyball, ate some food from grill and talked each other :)

22/07/2019
---
Mooonday üòçüòç. I really missed that ... all the meetings and work to do. Weather outside also started to being beautiful so I also have more energy! üòÅ

23/07/2019
---
Another great day! Today I got confirmation about my travel to the client. So in 2 weeks I'm going to Germany for a week. Actually I'm happy because of that, I wasn't there for a long time - 8 months!ü§ó

24/07/2019
---
Work, work, work.. A lot of work to do this week. I know everything will pay off so I give 100% of myself. In the evening, to de-stress I went on a bike with my cousin. We've made 20 km üòé

25/07/2019
---
Time flies by like crazy üòè. It's Thursday already! I have everything prepared for my travel to Germany (plane, hotels, car rent). I just need to get details how much cash I need and if everything is paid already or not. I have a week for that üëçüëä 

26/07/2019
---
Last days are really crazy. I'm in the position where I want to change company. The motivation to do this is due to the technology I currently work with... It's legacy and I know that I can't learn much more in that area + it'll not be useful in the future. I feel a little bad just because of my boss who was a great boss so far üëè

27/07/2019
---
Ahh! What a great Saturday! I've been learning a lot about business - especially about what I need to create my own, law in the Poland, etc... There's so much to learn in this area or maybe I should say too much ...üòÖ
