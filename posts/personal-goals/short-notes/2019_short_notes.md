First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

02/01/2019
---
Today I did a workout üí™üí™ and went to the swimming pool üèä. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time. 

03/01/2019
---
What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

04/01/2019
---
Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

05/01/2019
---
5th day of 2019 officialy ended. Today I coocked a really tasty meal! Chicken with rice (sounds normal, but it was SUPER good). Tomorrow I'll add some vegetables (especially broccoli) to this. I like cooking! üî™üëç

06/01/2019
---
I forgot about this completely! It's a day after and I realized I didn't write anything here. Shame on me!

07/01/2019
---
Totday was 1st real work day in this year. We had a meeting with summary of what is left to do. I was also celebrating 2nd Christmas (Orthodox) with family. Here, where I live, we're celebrating everything :D.

08/01/2019
---
First day in the office in this year. I've not been in the office since almost 3 weeks! It's good to be back in here :)

09/01/2019
---
It was a good day. In work all is on a good road. The only thing I missing is knowledge :D. I need to learn more and learn harder to be a better developer!!

10/01/2019
---
Today after back from work I ate dinner and with roommates we started cleaning our flat. It took us almost 3 hours to clean it all. I feel proud of us because we were planning that since few months but noone wasn't to take an action and today - we all took!

11/01/2019
---
Today 2 of my friends came to our flat. They have studies this weekend and that's the reason why. It was a fun evening :).

12/01/2019
---
I had my thesis presentation on seminar at studies. It is always kind of stressfull when I have to present something in front of a people. But I did it and the result is that I have to prepare better and cut the duration. 

13/01/2019
---
Sunday. I ate dinner with my family at my parents. It is always good to spend time with your family. I love them and it is really important for everyone to respect family and find time for them!

14/01/2019
---
Our production server was down the whole day. I had a time to learn something new and to focus a little bit on my stuff.

15/01/2019
---
It was a pretty tough day! I got off from work a little bit earlier because I had to do some papers to school. But after returning to home I had few emails about new tasks. Beside of that I had to make some project on studies with my colleague. A lot of things to do and the day is only 24h :D.

16/01/2019
---
Studying, studying, studying... Lately there is a lot of this. My day very often looks like this: work > dinner after work > workout > studying. But to be honest, I like to study :)

17/01/2019
---
Today in work we had a meeting about future and the current state of our project. In the end of the March we'll have a final decision if project go further or fails. Beside of that it was a good day! üëçüëç

18/01/2019
---
I had awesome day! And honestly, I don't know why... I had the feeling of coming spring and I LOVE it. I really want it to be spring now! Today I also came back to my hometown for a weekend :)

19/01/2019
---
I slept 10 hours and I don't feel bad about it. I know that my body sometimes needs a longer rest and if I can do it, I do it.

20/01/2019
---
Today after dinner I came back to Bialystok (the place where I work). To be honest, I don't know how long I'll stay here (I mean in the flat I currently living) because my roommate is moving out and we had a good relationships.

21/01/2019
---
Today I got offer from one of my colleagues on current project to join the another project he works on. I think I'll take it. I talk to my boss and he said it's ok for him. I'll probably know more details tomorrow.

22/01/2019
---
I felt really terrible today. I had a headache and couldn't focus on things I had to do. I went sleep at 9 pm... ;)

23/01/2019
---
That was a good day. I finally settled matters with my diploma thesis. I gave it to the dean's office. In work we're configuring cluster environment so I have to figure out how to deploy on it. That's interesting and challenging (I have never worked with cluster systems before).

24/01/2019
---
I finally finished one of my critical tasks today! The one drawback on this is that I can't test it until install on production. I see how (unit) tests gives a hidden power of not beeing afraid of modyfing etc. Sometimes I even feel guilty when I write a code and didn't write tests to it :D.

25/01/2019
---
I finally took a decision about new project. I'm on board. From the next week I'm starting to work on second project (the same client). I took it only for one reason: experience.

26/01/2019
---
Today was the last day of my studies. I think I have successfully completed my education (at least bachelor). I have to defend my diploma thesis and officially I'll be an engineer!

27/01/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. At the morning I've been at the church then afterwords I went on swimming pool. I relaxed myself and had conversation with a friend who's the lifeguard there.

28/01/2019
---
Monday.. I woke up at 5am, breakfast, work, workout, learning and sleep. In short it was all day. It was good. I think that at the end of the week I'll take some remote work so that I can concentrate more on learning to defend my diploma thesis.

29/01/2019
---
Lately I have terrible headaches while intense work. I hope it isn't anything serious. I'll work tomorrow with the pomodoro technique to see results.

30/01/2019
---
What a crazy day! I have some critical bug reports in our system and I don't know what causes it... Additionally I have to learn a lot to my diploma exam. One more news, I'll probably have to move out of the flat I'm currently renting 'cause my roommates are moving out.

31/01/2019
---
I was at the jsession today which is a group of the java developers. There was 2 talks. First about functional programming in Scala and the second one about profiling the applications. In my opinion the second one was better. It was presented by a deaveloper with 12 years experience that was talking on his life experience with profiling. 

01/02/2019
---
Friiiiday!! Start of the weekend :)! I was at the swimming pool with a couple of colleagues. It was a good time and I could relax. Besides, I have a lot of learning to my diploma exam. 

02/02/2019
---
Today I've been a procrastinating. I learned something for my diploma exam, but I know I could have done more. Anyway, rest is also very important so balance is the best option.

03/02/2019
---
What a laaazy Sunday. Buy, I wish we'll have a spring/summer right now. I just want to go outside, take off a shirt and get a sun!!

04/02/2019
---
And the Monday. Everything was good at work. When I got home I ate a dinner, which I took from home :D and I did a training. Then I studied to diploma exam and repeated my presentation. I have to present it 2 min faster (today it was 11 min).

05/02/2019
---
It's getting closer and closer to the final day of thesis exam. It's on Thursday. I think I'm ready to that. I've been learning a lot in last and current week. We'll see the result :)

06/02/2019
---
Work and study. This words describe my last days clearly. Tomorrow is a day of truth - will I be an engineer? Tomorrow I'll know that.

07/02/2019
---
I have it! 5 on my diploma exam :) and I'm super happy :D. From tomorrow I'm starting my first 25 days challenge - breath holding. It will last unti 5 of March and I'll update my best 'score' every week in readme file (just to see potential progress).

08/02/2019
---
I went on volleyball training and after warmup I decided it's not for me. I suck. I wasn't playing for 2 months and I literally suck. So after warmup I took my stuff and went on swimming pool which is next to the place where we had a training.

That was a good day. I've been so productive. First I finished exercises for chapter 7 of git course. Afterwards I created a shell script to auto commit and push and finally I was learning some English (I need someone to practice speaking altogether with me).

10/02/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. I was at the church, then we had a family dinner. I watched a ski jumping competition and drove to Bialystok. That's how the day looked like in a shortcut üòâ.

11/02/2019
---
Arghh.. We've got something incorrectly configured on our systems and one thing doesn't want to work. It took me the whole day to figure it and all I know for now is - it doesn't work. It's really bad when things like this happends especially when you have other tasks to do in this week.

12/02/2019
---
Yesterday's problem. Not solved. Anyway I'll create a ticket to support for help on that topic and I want to focus my attention on other tasks. I have a new task with some changes in the code. The code is 3-4 months old but it is already defined as legacy code. No tests and I want to improve this code better by entering tests for this code!

13/02/2019

Today in the flat I rent the owners made some renovation. When I came back from work, they were still here painting the walls. I also have a new bed. Much more comfortable than the previous one :).

14/02/2019
---
It's almost the end of the week. Time flies by so fast ... Today I worked a little bit longer (officialy 8h in the office) and 3 hours at home because tomorrow we have a meeting about topic I didn't know very well. That's why I worked after hours to 'get in' the topic. Anyway tomorrow probably I'll finish 3 hours earlier :)

15/02/2019
---
Yooho! Friday :). With friends I was at the swimming pool and I ate strawberries today! It was yummy..

16/02/2019
---
I spent todays evening with my friends. We were sitting in their flat and we chatted about life and other stuff.

17/02/2019
---
Today, with family we had a little celebration day. It was my mom's birthday. It was a good time with family (and cake :D).

18/02/2019
---
I had to submit documents for studies, so I left work at 12 in the morning and went to university. When I submitted my master's degree papers, there were two levels of English to choose from: B2 + and C1. I do not feel up to level C1, but all B2 + slots have been filled, so I had to ... I'm not sure if this decision about studying is good, but we'll see :)

19/02/2019
---
Arghh!! I got angry so bad today! I had an appointment to a doctor at 10:45. I was in there right on time. I registered, there were a few people in front of me (like 5 or 6). Everything was fine until now. After 2 hours of waiting I couldn't take it anymore (I had a meeting at 1 PM) I asked what my position was in the queue.... I was 4th. I just took my papers and left.

20/02/2019
---
Ha!! I planned to go to the doctor on Thursday but I decided to back to my hometown today and ... I did papers for studies in 30 min instead of 2 hours of waiting in queue :)!

21/02/2019
---
Another good day :). I worked remotely today. I really like to work like this especially at the summer time when you can go outside and get some sun + do some work. Additionally I went on swimming pool (as always), had some chill time ... ;)

22/02/2019
---
Ye!! Friday :). I went on swimming pool with my cousin today, it was nice. There is also a new schedule for my master's studies, which doesn't look bad. I have a busy Monday and Tuesday, but other days looks good :)

23/02/2019
---
That was a good day! We had 'holiday' at our church. There was many people and friends. Afterwards with a group of friends we went to my aunt house and we were chatting :)

24/02/2019
---
I almost forgot to write today's note. Uff... I used this beautiful Sunday to meet my friends and be with family. :D

25/02/2019
---
What a day. Literally, I didn't have time to do anything. I went out at 10am and returned at 8pm. Mondays are gonna be tough.

26/02/2019
---
Today I had classes related to math... Aaaaa I'm scared a bit. I've always been terrible in math and I think it's not better now.

27/02/2019
---
And we're at the middle of the week. Today I had less classes so I could spend some time on my own things. In addition I ate a good lunch (vegetables and rice).

28/02/2019
---
That was the last day of February. Today I was at the jSession, which is java communicy meeting. There was 2 presentations - first about how to not make our code legacy and the second one about AWS and serverless. Meetings like that are a great occassion to meet new people.

01/03/2019
---
Friday and the new month. Sounds great! :). I did back to my hometown and went to the swimming pool with my cousins. Arghh! And one more thing. My car broke down, luckily after returning home. I don't know much about car mechanics, so tomorrow with my dad we'll see together what happened there.

02/03/2019
---
I spent the day at home. I had fun with my brother's son :). Unfortunately, the problem with the car is serious and I have to give it to the mechanic.

03/03/2019
---
It was regular Sunday. I went to church and then we had a family dinner. In the evening I went to the city where I work (I borrowed a car from my parents).

04/03/2019
---
Monday.. Actually, I like Mondays. It's not always easy to handle a new week, but when you have a good approach, you can do it. I can do it for sure (ofc. sometimes there are bad moments but this is rare). 

05/03/2019
---
This is the last day of my breath hold challenge! I found it very usefull, but unfortunately I don't have time for it (even if it takes 20 minutes a day). I'm glad that recently I don't have so many tasks at work so I can focus more on my studying.

06/03/2019
---
That was interesting day. Ofc. a lot of studying, but today it was something different. I was creating very simple app in react-native. First I had to configure to make it work altogether with Java 11, which took me a while. At the late afternoon I got an email with a job offer which is quite interesting... I'm already on 2 projects so we'll see where this whole situation will go.

07/03/2019
---
What a day! Until afternoon everything was going smoothly. And at one moment, EMAIL, EMAIL, EMAIL... that was overwhelming. Thanks God, I manage to prioritize the tasks that came and I solved them one by one. Well, not exactly all of them but at least I'm at good starting point for tomorrow continuation ;)

08/03/2019
---
Today I had a job interview with a HR recruiter. We talked on the phone for an hour and on next Wednesday I have technical interview. If I succeed I'll have a lot of work to do... But we'll see after Wednesday :)  

09/03/2019
---
I wanted to learn math today, but I was preparing myself for job interview. I also met with my friends and went to a hairdresser (which is actually my friend). And ofc. I went to the pool :)

10/03/2019
---
I always try to be positive but what happend today.... makes me RAGE! Our new roommate has invited some of his 'friends' BUT these weren't normal people (I'm sorry to say this), they were bums who stink terribly and what is worse THEY STAY FOR A NIGHT! It's 100% certain that tomorrow I'm calling the owner of the aparment to talk about it. And it's me or him. Someone has to leave.

11/03/2019
---
When I woke up I was still angry. I called owner of our flat and described the situation. She wasn't happy (in warm words). Fortunatelly situation is established right now and hopefully it won't ever happen again.

12/03/2019
---
It was a very ordinary day. Work -> School -> Work -> Studying. In the end, our new roommate didn't cause problems in the evening but anyway we need to get rid of him (we don't trust him and we can't lock our rooms).

13/03/2019
---
I had technical job interview today. It was very interesting. The guy, who had conversation with me asked me a lot of questions where I had to think instead of know something. I don't know if they'll offer me job after this talk but still, it was very nice talk.

14/03/2019
---
Hi! It was a good day. I had better in my life but it was fine :). I'm thinking of find new flat to rent 'cause I'm tired of living here with that new roommate and actually I'm kind of scared of him.

15/03/2019
---
I got sick :(. The whole day I felt terrible and I went sleep at 5 pm..

16/03/2019
---
Wow! I slept 14 hours!! And what is most important I felt good today :). I'm not sick anymore. Today I met with my friends and also went on swimming pool.

17/03/2019
---
Today I celebrated friend birthday üéÇ! It was a good Sunday with beautiful weather. I wish spring to come faster :)

18/03/2019
---
Another really weird day!!! My roommate (not the new one) went CRAZY! He wanted to commit suicide... He left a farewell letter etc.. I lost all afternoon and evening dealing with the police and so on.I also told our owner of the aparment that I'm leaving and I don't want to live there anymore. She totally understood this. Ultimately, the roommate was found and is safe.

19/03/2019
---
It was a good day. At the evening we met with few friends on pizza. Good and fun time. I needed that :)

20/03/2019
---
I finished things related to renting an apartment. I paid (a lot) for the last 2 months and gave the keys to the owner.

21/03/2019
---
Bum! My job offer was rejected. They say that they need someone more experienced and I can try again in 4-6 months. I have to learn more and start sharing my knowledge :)

22/03/2019
---
Yuuhuuu! Friday :). I'm thinking of starting some new project where I can use Spring, Hibernate, Angular etc.. In general new technologies... I really don't want to have any technical debt. I have to find problem which is interesting to me so I'll be motivated and have fun.

23/03/2019
---
It was beautiful Saturday! Sun was shining and the weather was perfect. Life is wonderful! We have to remember this :)
