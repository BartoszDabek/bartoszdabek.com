First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

Today I did a workout 💪💪 and went to the swimming pool 🏊. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time.

What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

5th day of 2019 officialy ended. Today I coocked a really tasty meal! Chicken with rice (sounds normal, but it was SUPER good). Tomorrow I'll add some vegetables (especially broccoli) to this. I like cooking! 🔪👍
