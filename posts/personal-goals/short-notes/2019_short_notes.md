First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

Today I did a workout üí™üí™ and went to the swimming pool üèä. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time.

What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

It was a good day. In work all is on a good road. The only thing I missing is knowledge :D. I need to learn more and learn harder to be a better developer!!

Today after back from work I ate dinner and with roommates we started cleaning our flat. It took us almost 3 hours to clean it all. I feel proud of us because we were planning that since few months but noone wasn't to take an action and today - we all took!

I had my thesis presentation on seminar at studies. It is always kind of stressfull when I have to present something in front of a people. But I did it and the result is that I have to prepare better and cut the duration.
