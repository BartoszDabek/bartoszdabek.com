Today I had a nail surgery. It hurt for a moment but now it's better... Now I have one week to recover myself because of sickness leave.

Definitely not a productive day... I woke up few minutes before 8 A.M and didn't have energy to do something creative. I think the reason is I don't want to do anything with my [Car crash app](https://github.com/bartoszdabek/4rescue) at this moment and my mind telling me to focus on it. Tomorrow I won't even think of it and will see the results.

Once again.. I had my alarm setted up at 4:50 A.M but got up at 7:30. But the day was not at all tragic. I did 20 kilometers on a bike and other things I planned. I guess significant was that yesterday I did a list of things I want to do today. Tomorrow I'm going on lake to take some rest of the life <3.

This day was good! I got up before 5 A.M, drank glass of water, prepared a really good breakfast and went to work! Excellent! After work did training and was learning English. I think I need to focus more on my engineer work and car crash app but still I don't feel it. Need to motivate myself to start it.. don't know how yet ðŸ˜’
