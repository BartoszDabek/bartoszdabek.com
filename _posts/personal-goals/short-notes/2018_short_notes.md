Today I had a nail surgery. It hurt for a moment but now it's better... Now I have one week to recover myself because of sickness leave.

Definitely not a productive day... I woke up few minutes before 8 A.M and didn't have energy to do something creative. I think the reason is I don't want to do anything with my [Car crash app](https://github.com/bartoszdabek/4rescue) at this moment and my mind telling me to focus on it. Tomorrow I won't even think of it and will see the results. 

11/07/2018

Once again.. I had my alarm setted up at 4:50 A.M but got up at 7:30. But the day was not at all tragic. I did 20 kilometers on a bike and other things I planned. I guess significant was that yesterday I did a list of things I want to do today. Tomorrow I'm going on lake to take some rest of the life <3. 

15/07/2018

After few days of rest on the lake it's time to back to say something. I did myself a little break of Internet, daily work and all of my planned habits. I think I reset my head good enough to be productive in this weekend (I hope so). 💪💪💪

This day was good! I got up before 5 A.M, drank glass of water, prepared a really good breakfast and went to work! Excellent! After work did training and was learning English. I think I need to focus more on my engineer work and car crash app but still I don't feel it. Need to motivate myself to start it.. don't know how yet 😒

Today I planned everything - every minute and I did all the things that was on my todo list. Additionally I did some extra - which I hadn't planned before. I started to learn to use git-svn which is actually pretty nice and in a very few days I'm planning to start using git-svn instead of the svn client. The important thing is that I got approval on my vacation in last two weeks of August... Now I have to figure out what I want to do at this time, in addition to rest 😀😀

Hi! I finished my work earlier today than usual, but ... (there is always but) just because I was waiting for an e-mail from coworkers to clarify something. After receiving the email I had to work 1 hour at home which I expected. Actually this day wasn't really exciting, just a normal day. Ohh one thing that dawned on me. My roommates found my 'daily to-do schedule' and asked me a lot of 'why'. 😫


19/07/2018
---
Woo hoo! What a day! I got up at 4:30 A.M and then I went running! Yes! Maybe the run wasn't that long (it lasted about 15 minutes) but still it is before 5 A.M !! I'm happy and I'm really proud of it so I have to say this to myself 'Good Job!'. Yeey ...

I'm thinking about changing the content of this daily-notes and what do I mean by changing the content? Well.. all my days are quite similar to others and my life isn't so exciting that I can write fabulous stories here. So maybe I should start writing about the happy things that happened or the happy thoughts I have. I don't know... Actually it's my content and I do what I want here. That's why I want to say that I'm grateful to God for my life, family, job and the wisdom He gave me and many other things that are too much personal to write them here. 🤗

Today I ran 5 km at 5:30 A.M and then at 6 P.M cycled 16 km. Overall it was a good day for me, I started writing my car crash app and finally I see some progress on that. Also while running and cycling I can see that many valuable ideas comming to my mind, I need to find a way to note them.✍️

Excellent morning, decent afternoon and evening = good day overall :). Today was a chillout day, I watched the F1 race and some athletic competitions. In addition I also did training and I coocked a tasty dinner :). Let's start new weekend!

23/07/2018

No fireworks today, just a normal day. Did my job, training and so on ... I have new task in job which is quite interesting and I'm struggling with TDD approach. I know it's good but my experience is not quite good, maybe I should buy some book about tests and TDD.

I ordered new shoes today, actually 2 pairs (in different colors), I hope they will match on my feet. Also I created a new branch on github in car crash app - branch for testing g-forces, and had a little fun with rebasing. And I finally know what is the difference between merge and rebase. 💪

25/07/2018
---
Today at 4:45 A.M I ran 2 km and started the day very actively. Actually I like mornings like this. I also installed the 'Lifelog' app on my phone to count steps I take (I have old phone which doesn't have build in step counter). 

26/07/2018

Another good one day. Today I realized that I love to get up early. I can do some of my 'daily routine' stuff done even before some ppl awake. It's nice! And it's something what motivates me.💪

Hello friday :)! It was a looong day, at the end of the day I was REALLY tired and I fell asleep so fast. I bought some clothes and shoes in tuesday/wednesday and today I were measuring them. Unfortunetally shoes doesn't really fit and I'm afraid I have to return them. Which is bad because I really like their style and what is more bad that it isn't that easy to buy nice shoes on my feet which is big enough (30,5 cm).

Arghhh.. I wished for good weather today, but the weather definietly didn't coopeate. It was really hot but so cloudy. Lately I can see that I have no enough time! Ofc I spend some time on yt and distractions like this which actually wasting my time but this is also needed to give myself a little entertainment. Also I talked with my friend today about investing money instead of freezing them we'll see what comes out of it.

Sooo hot Sunday we had in here! It was 30 degrees and no lake! :( As always in Sunday I gave myself a little break from 'productive' style of life. The good news is that my good friend came from Belgium and will stay one week so I'm thinking of taking remote work instead of sitting in the office so we can hang out.😎

Today we had webex meeting with our team, talking about the project we are on, current status and so on. I need to focus on my task now because in thursday I have a short presentation of what is done and howdoes it works. Also I started watching [JS videos by Java Brains](https://javabrains.io/courses/corejs_jsfordev/) which I think is really great. 

31/07/2018

Last day of July. Time really flies by. Today I decided that I want to measure my expenses and incomes so I'll know how much can I safe monthly. I'm starting with first of August. I downloaded the app 'Money Manager' which gonna help me in it.

Today I had great evening. I met with friends and we were talking in public park until late hours that means I hadn't long sleep but it was worth it!

02/08/2018

I slept today 4,30h but after morning cofee (really morning :D) it was OK. I had a little presentation today about my task in job, all went well, I got some feedback about it and it's good! Also once again we had a great evening with our friends. Life is good! :)

03/08/2018

Once again - 5h of sleep. It's ok when I'm waking up but I think I need one night without alarm... so I can charge my physical batteries. It's really hot summer and every evening I'm hanging out with my friends so it's hard to do something more (meaning learn something) but I really enjoy this (whos not :D).

Today we had baptism in our church. At the evening I spent good time with friends, just talking :).

05/08/2018

Great Sunday, I was completely off the computer, I only committed weekly review in the morning. Next week gonna be more effective, because I'm going back to the city where I work.

06/08/2018

Wow! That was definietly the worst Monday since I work in my company. And I don't mean like something bad happend, but my productivity and fatigue. I almost slept on my desk.. It's note for me: next time just go home, sleep few hours and then start work because yesterday ... really I did nothing value.

07/08/2018

Pretty good day. I think I should call it decent. Nothing special happened or anything bad. At the weekend we have plans with friends to go to the lake but I will decide on Thursday whether to go or not. If the weather will cooperate then I'm on board.

08/08/2018

Not a lot to talk about. I watched a lot of videos about JS on youtube and some others stuff (which killed my time). I have also found a 'shops' where I can design my own T-shirts which I actually planning to release in June 2019.

What a morning! :D I woke up and went running, while running I listened to music with earphones on and suddenly one of my earphones came out BUT the rubber was left in my ear. I tried to pull it out but only pushed it deeper. So I had to go to the hospital to take it out. At the moment it's a really funny story, but when I had this rubber in my ear, believe me it wasn't :D.

Almost 8 hours of sleep today because I didn't wake up when alarm ringed. It's good, I mean sometimes we need more sleep. Today I struggled with a task I have in job. Task looks easy but if we go into details it isn't. 

11/08/2018

Another good Saturday :) I was running, cycling, writing something in a car crash app, I did a workout. Really one thing I regret is that I didn't meet with my friends but .. yeah I had a lot of this last week so I can call it even.

12/08/2018

Today I made up for my arrears yesterday and met with friends on the grill. We spent quality time talking and so on :D. Firstly I planned to go back to the city I work but after some time I decided to stay in home town and drive tomorrow. That was a good decision :).

13/08/2018
---
Whole day at work I was struggling with the task from Friday ... and still it isn't finished. Hope tomorrow I'll finish that because sometimes even after work I'm thinking of how to resolve it (SOMETIMES! :D).

14/08/2018
---
Finally moved on with the task! And I did back to my hometown. Yeeey! Today the weather wasn't so good but good enough to go for a bike :D. Now I need diet plan because I want to build more muscle mass, but I think I'll start doing it in September.

15/08/2018

Today is a national holiday and it's a day off at work. I spent the morning and early afternoon on my own tasks (cleaning :D etc.) and later, I met with my friends at homemade pizza and something sweet :D. 

16/08/2018

It's been a month since I write here regulary, nice! And you know if anyone ever reads it (even me in the future) it's worth doing. I spend 2-5 minutes on it (it depends on the day) but in my head it's a feeling: 'Look, you have done something today!' and it's good! 

17/08/2018

Arghhhh.. Terrible day, one of my friends with whom we planned to go on a trip, he said he can't do it. When he said that, it ruined my day because all my thoughts were: 'Why now? When we have to leave in 5 days, and most things are already planned"...

18/08/2018
---
Today I finished my work finally and I'm free, I mean I can truly relax during my holidays. I hope I'll, especially my brain from all these mundane, work related task. 

19/08/2018

The most anti social Sunday I had until few months. I didn't meet up with any of my friends/colleagues, well in fact I did because I was in a church at the morning. Instead of that I was watching a lot of YT (not for fun only), and did some work on my personal projects.

20/08/2018
---
Today I focused on car crash app project. I spent 5 hours on fixing unit tests (by fixing I mean make them run), it was terrible! I wrote 3 classes, one test class and then I was trying to run that test. Finally I did, but man... a lot of effort and still I don't have an idea why it's works! :D. Well, tomorrow fight part.2 💪

21/08/2018
---
Haha! Today I had a lot of laugh :D. I realized why yesterday tests didn't work. It was because I placed them in wrong folders :D. Funny that I lost so many hours and really didn't focus on that thing! But.. what is moreover interesting is that, actually I made them work in wrong folders! It's odd that it really worked in there.

22/08/2018

I can tell - it was a good Wednesday. Today we planned to go on our trip, but plan changed and we leave tomorrow morning (REALLY MORNING at 3 AM :D). I did everything I planned for this week so I'm happy. I also hope that this trip won't break my 'good habits' and we'll have a good time.

23/08/2018
---
Ohh! What a day! :D. 4 hours before the trip, our friend's mum called and cancelled his trip (because he's too young) so only me and one of my friends drove. But it worked. We did it and I can say that I'm happy and I don't regret that I'm here (right now we're at a friend's house in some small village), it's beautifull, it's relaxing... It's vacation! :)

24/08/2018

Ok.. Today really fast note :D. We had a great time with friends on our trip and I really enjoy this time :) !!

We have been at aquapark today and then later on grill at my family. As always - gooooood time.. and good food :).
