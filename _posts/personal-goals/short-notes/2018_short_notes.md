Today I had a nail surgery. It hurt for a moment but now it's better... Now I have one week to recover myself because of sickness leave.

Definitely not a productive day... I woke up few minutes before 8 A.M and didn't have energy to do something creative. I think the reason is I don't want to do anything with my [Car crash app](https://github.com/bartoszdabek/4rescue) at this moment and my mind telling me to focus on it. Tomorrow I won't even think of it and will see the results.

Once again.. I had my alarm setted up at 4:50 A.M but got up at 7:30. But the day was not at all tragic. I did 20 kilometers on a bike and other things I planned. I guess significant was that yesterday I did a list of things I want to do today. Tomorrow I'm going on lake to take some rest of the life <3.

After few days of rest on the lake it's time to back to say something. I did myself a little break of Internet, daily work and all of my planned habits. I think I reset my head good enough to be productive in this weekend (I hope so). 💪💪💪

This day was good! I got up before 5 A.M, drank glass of water, prepared a really good breakfast and went to work! Excellent! After work did training and was learning English. I think I need to focus more on my engineer work and car crash app but still I don't feel it. Need to motivate myself to start it.. don't know how yet 😒

Today I planned everything - every minute and I did all the things that was on my todo list. Additionally I did some extra - which I hadn't planned before. I started to learn to use git-svn which is actually pretty nice and in a very few days I'm planning to start using git-svn instead of the svn client. The important thing is that I got approval on my vacation in last two weeks of August... Now I have to figure out what I want to do at this time, in addition to rest 😀😀

Hi! I finished my work earlier today than usual, but ... (there is always but) just because I was waiting for an e-mail from coworkers to clarify something. After receiving the email I had to work 1 hour at home which I expected. Actually this day wasn't really exciting, just a normal day. Ohh one thing that dawned on me. My roommates found my 'daily to-do schedule' and asked me a lot of 'why'. 😫

Woo hoo! What a day! I got up at 4:30 A.M and then I went running! Yes! Maybe the run wasn't that long (it lasted about 15 minutes) but still it is before 5 A.M !! I'm happy and I'm really proud of it so I have to say this to myself 'Good Job!'. Yeey ...

I'm thinking about changing the content of this daily-notes and what do I mean by changing the content? Well.. all my days are quite similar to others and my life isn't so exciting that I can write fabulous stories here. So maybe I should start writing about the happy things that happened or the happy thoughts I have. I don't know... Actually it's my content and I do what I want here. That's why I want to say that I'm grateful to God for my life, family, job and the wisdom He gave me and many other things that are too much personal to write them here. 🤗

Today I ran 5 km at 5:30 A.M and then at 6 P.M cycled 16 km. Overall it was a good day for me, I started writing my car crash app and finally I see some progress on that. Also while running and cycling I can see that many valuable ideas comming to my mind, I need to find a way to note them.✍️

Excellent morning, decent afternoon and evening = good day overall :). Today was a chillout day, I watched the F1 race and some athletic competitions. In addition I also did training and I coocked a tasty dinner :). Let's start new weekend!

No fireworks today, just a normal day. Did my job, training and so on ... I have new task in job which is quite interesting and I'm struggling with TDD approach. I know it's good but my experience is not quite good, maybe I should buy some book about tests and TDD.

I ordered new shoes today, actually 2 pairs (in different colors), I hope they will match on my feet. Also I created a new branch on github in car crash app - branch for testing g-forces, and had a little fun with rebasing. And I finally know what is the difference between merge and rebase. 💪

Today at 4:45 A.M I ran 2 km and started the day very actively. Actually I like mornings like this. I also installed the 'Lifelog' app on my phone to count steps I take (I have old phone which doesn't have build in step counter).

Another good one day. Today I realized that I love to get up early. I can do some of my 'daily routine' stuff done even before some ppl awake. It's nice! And it's something what motivates me.💪

Hello friday :)! It was a looong day, at the end of the day I was REALLY tired and I fell asleep so fast. I bought some clothes and shoes in tuesday/wednesday and today I were measuring them. Unfortunetally shoes doesn't really fit and I'm afraid I have to return them. Which is bad because I really like their style and what is more bad that it isn't that easy to buy nice shoes on my feet which is big enough (30,5 cm).

Arghhh.. I wished for good weather today, but the weather definietly didn't coopeate. It was really hot but so cloudy. Lately I can see that I have no enough time! Ofc I spend some time on yt and distractions like this which actually wasting my time but this is also needed to give myself a little entertainment. Also I talked with my friend today about investing money instead of freezing them we'll see what comes out of it.
