Today I had a nail surgery. It hurt for a moment but now it's better... Now I have one week to recover myself because of sickness leave.

Definitely not a productive day... I woke up few minutes before 8 A.M and didn't have energy to do something creative. I think the reason is I don't want to do anything with my [Car crash app](https://github.com/bartoszdabek/4rescue) at this moment and my mind telling me to focus on it. Tomorrow I won't even think of it and will see the results.
