Today I had a nail surgery. It hurt for a moment but now it's better... Now I have one week to recover myself because of sickness leave.

Definitely not a productive day... I woke up few minutes before 8 A.M and didn't have energy to do something creative. I think the reason is I don't want to do anything with my [Car crash app](https://github.com/bartoszdabek/4rescue) at this moment and my mind telling me to focus on it. Tomorrow I won't even think of it and will see the results.

Once again.. I had my alarm setted up at 4:50 A.M but got up at 7:30. But the day was not at all tragic. I did 20 kilometers on a bike and other things I planned. I guess significant was that yesterday I did a list of things I want to do today. Tomorrow I'm going on lake to take some rest of the life <3.

After few days of rest on the lake it's time to back to say something. I did myself a little break of Internet, daily work and all of my planned habits. I think I reset my head good enough to be productive in this weekend (I hope so). ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

This day was good! I got up before 5 A.M, drank glass of water, prepared a really good breakfast and went to work! Excellent! After work did training and was learning English. I think I need to focus more on my engineer work and car crash app but still I don't feel it. Need to motivate myself to start it.. don't know how yet ðŸ˜’

Today I planned everything - every minute and I did all the things that was on my todo list. Additionally I did some extra - which I hadn't planned before. I started to learn to use git-svn which is actually pretty nice and in a very few days I'm planning to start using git-svn instead of the svn client. The important thing is that I got approval on my vacation in last two weeks of August... Now I have to figure out what I want to do at this time, in addition to rest ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

Hi! I finished my work earlier today than usual, but ... (there is always but) just because I was waiting for an e-mail from coworkers to clarify something. After receiving the email I had to work 1 hour at home which I expected. Actually this day wasn't really exciting, just a normal day. Ohh one thing that dawned on me. My roommates found my 'daily to-do schedule' and asked me a lot of 'why'. ðŸ˜«
