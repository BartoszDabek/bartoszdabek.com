### Week in Review
This week was ok. I had a lot of work but at the end of the week (especially in Friday) I had more free time. Right now when I'm in my hometown I'm using it to spend my time active (running, cycling). This week I also learned how to work with vim in multi-file mode. Which is so fun to know and have this possibility to impress someone :D ðŸ‘Œ. I'm happy. I'm grateful to God for my life and all I have ... family, health, my job.. and many others :)
