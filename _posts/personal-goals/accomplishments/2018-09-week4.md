### Week in Review
This week I traveled a lot. Didn't have a lot of time for myself but still I think my mental grown is on good way and I'm not stopping. This week I listened to many podcasts, I read a lot but again big downside for me - I didn't work enough. I need to focus more on doing things, like writing my car cras app and LEARNING ENGLISH (especially new vocabulary).
