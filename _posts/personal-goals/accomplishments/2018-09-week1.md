### Week in Review
This week I went to Germany. I had a lot of work and didn't have time :(. Because of this trip I neglected my daily habits and diet, but I'll come back stronger ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª. I'm proud that every day in the hotel rooms, in the morning I did workouts. To summarize this week I have to say that it was OK, not the best but it could have been worse.
