### Week in Review
This week I had ups and downs. I had a lot of activity (107 km tracked on the endomono and we still have Sunday), I listened to many podcasts (especially 'Rich Dad Poor Dad with AJ Hoge podcasts). This were my ups. Let's mention some falls: one of my friend resigned from a trip we planned (I was really angry because of that) and another down is that I haven't finished the tasks with car crash app and I haven't written a post about command design pattern. But in the next week I'll catch up.
