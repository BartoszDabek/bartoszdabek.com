### Week in Review
Hmm... what to say about this week? It was a very ordinary week - work, studies and some time for my own activities 🤨. But... with one exception - Friday was free because of the national holiday :). I really appreciated this extra day off! I have found that in the future I want my work week to be 4 days (or less) instead of 5 🙂. But I know that I have to work hard now to reap the benefits later (yes - the SPI show intro 😃) 💪💪.
