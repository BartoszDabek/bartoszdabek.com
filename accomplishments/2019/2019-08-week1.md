### Week in Review
Few words about this week. Hmm... It was tough but good week. I had to decide which job I want and I truly belive that God helped me with a right choice here. Again - as in previous week - I didn't do anything with my microservice idea and git presentation 😪. I'm procrastinating that and have no idea why ☹️. Well... on other side I accomplished a lot this week :) I also published my first yt video that you can find [here](https://youtu.be/W9iuMxQXrCg).
