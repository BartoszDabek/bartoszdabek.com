### Week in Review
Hi 👋! It's been a long week. Lately I feel tired after each week... I think this is because there is so much to do. I know that next year I'll have much more time and finally I'll have time for my OWN aspirations and things that I want to do! That keeps me motivated. Recently I realized that I'm wasting a lot of time on youtube - I don't even want to know how much time I spend there but I think about an hour a day 😒. The only question is - how much of that time is wasted? Very often the content I watch teaches me something - not always, but very often 🙄.
