### Week in Review
I don't like to complain but this week wasn't that good. Most of this was caused by our new roommate and all the strange situations he created. Besides I got sick on Friday and the whole day was terrible. Of course, there were a few good situations this week, such as technical job interview. I hope for a better week next week :)
