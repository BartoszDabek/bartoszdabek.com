### Week in Review
It was a long and tough week. Lately I have really too much to-do in work and I need to also deal with my studies. But, let's take those problems on a side... This week was also pretty cool. Actually I found a lot of time for my friends - I went out on swimming pool, some fast food, wedding... Yeahhh, the last one was planned few months before😁😁
