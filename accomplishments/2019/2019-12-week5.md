### Week in Review
It was another week of blessing in my life 🙏💪. Thank God for health and everything else I have! This week I partially organized a bachelor "party" because in 3 weeks I'll be a witness at the wedding 😉. I was in my hometown all week and spent Christmas here with my family. Of course, during the week I had a lot of work to do but I think I found a balance between work and life (at least in this week) 🙂👍.
