### Week in Review
It was a good week. I had a lot to do at work - new team, new challenges, new technologies, there is a lot to learn and I like it 🤗👍. Eveything is new and fresh compared to my previous projects. Besides, now I have my own - a one-man company - and I've had a lot to do with it over the past month, but thank God everything has been done 👏! My personal life is also fine. I try my best to stay fit - 3 home workouts a week, a few kilometers by bike + running and keeping diet (calories counting) 💪💪. I really like these activities because I feel like I accomplished something every week 😀😁!
