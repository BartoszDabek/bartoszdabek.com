### Week in Review
It was a good week. A lot has happend, especially in my work area. I got a job offer and I really have high expectations for this. A few words about things from the list that I didn't do this week - the main excuse is that I didn't have time ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶. You can laugh but it's true. All things related to the new job offer + current job (I have 2 projects here). There's a lot to do and this week was very busy. But to be honest, if I ask myself: how much time did I spend on yt and unimportant stuff? I don't want to answer it but the answer is if I spent this time on things to do from the list, it would be finished.
