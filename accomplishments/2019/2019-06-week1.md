### Week in Review
It was a busy week for sure but it was really good. I don't regret that I'm at this moment here in Silesia. It's good to find time for your family and friends. Focusing everything on work is wrong! You'll always have work and something else to do! With age we have more responsibilities and won't have time for enjoying life! It's a note to me - ENJOY LIFE in a good way as long as you can and have energy!!
