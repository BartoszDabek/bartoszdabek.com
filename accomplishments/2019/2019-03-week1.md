### Week in Review
Another good week. This was the first week of studying and I must say it's kind of tough to reconcile work with studies... but anyway, I'm OK yet :D. This is the second week when I can't start refactoring the 4Rescue app (due to lack of time). I think I have to move this task to 'Things I'll do in the future'. I also notice how powerful is the planning of the upcomming week and the opportunity to see the results at the end! 👊👊
