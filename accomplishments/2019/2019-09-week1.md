### Week in Review
Let's rock this week review ðŸ‘Š! It was another very successful week. At work I overhanded two projects and started onboarding process (on my own by reading documentation in sharepoint) to the new one. There is something I think I didn't mention before - since tomorrow I'll be officialy have my own company - the business model is very simple. It's a company with one worker - me ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª. I hope God will bless me :)
