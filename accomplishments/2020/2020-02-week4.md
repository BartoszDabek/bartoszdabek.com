### Week in Review
It was another good week. I really like the fact that the summer is getting closer. And even though it wasn't snowing this winter, I still want the summer 😎! I plan to do a bike tour in June with my friends - there would be about 110-115 km to go 🚴, so for amateurs it is a whole day's ride (+ that's about spending time together and having fun 👍). As far as this week is concerned, as you can see the whole list is finished - although I don't impose a lot of tasks either, it's just because I'm trying to experiment with my abilities lately and watch how I react to things 👀🤯.
