### Week in Review
As you can see in the list of achievements this week was super productive 👍🏻💪🏻! I felt really good and apart from a lot of work I managed to achieve everything - nice! This week I was also at the funeral - it was a good time to think about death and the future. Of the interesting things yet, my cousin offered me to be a witness at his wedding - I haven't made a decision yet, but I think I'll say yes. 😉
