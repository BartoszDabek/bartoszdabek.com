### Week in Review
This week was beautiful but not easy. I can probably say that it was one of the harder weeks at work this year. There was a lot of spoilage at work and thus a lot of stress - although I managed to deal with it through sport 😏. But thanks to the fact that I tried to cut off from work at specific hours, my private life did not suffer. I'll say more - I'm very happy with this week because in the middle of the week I managed to meet and go for a walk with my friend 🙂. Additionally, my whole to-do list has been completed and one more important thing - my thesis has been completed in 100% and sent to the final evaluation by the anti-plagiarism system (I hope it will pass) 😅.
