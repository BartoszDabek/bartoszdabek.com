### Week in Review
It's been a tough week - especially at work 🤯. For the most part of the week I had to do a lot of analytical work before I started to implement. Besides, I started studies - I had my first classes in this semester and what's most important is that this semester we have very few classes 👍👍 I am very happy about that 😆! What I'm saying to myself - 3 more months of such hard work (studies + work + thesis) and I will finally be able to rest 🤗.
