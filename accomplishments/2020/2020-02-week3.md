### Week in Review
It was another good week 👍. To be honest, I don't remember what exactly happened in it 😅. But I do notice one thing - how much time I have because I don't have classes at the university (mid-term break). This is beautiful 🤗. As far as this week is concerned, the end is a little bit worse because I got a little bit sick 😷 but I hope it will pass quickly and I will return to shape 💪.
