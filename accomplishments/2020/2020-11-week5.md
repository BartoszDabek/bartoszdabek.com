### Week in Review
It was another good week in my life 🙂. Some key things happened to me. First of all, a friend of mine wrote to me, with whom I live very well and I treat her more than my friend, but we will see what time brings and if we are for each other. Two, I was approached by my boss from one of the previous projects I took part in. We talked for a while about the details and we will see what comes out of it 🤫. So much for the key things this week. Besides, I feel good and thank God I am healthy 🙏!
