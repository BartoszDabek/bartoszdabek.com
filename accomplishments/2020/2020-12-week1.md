### Week in Review
This week was good 👌. At work I finally got all the access I needed to work more independently! While staying at work, I also got a job offer I'm considering very seriously and I have a big dilemma 🤔🤔. When it comes to private life, everything is fine at 🙃! I'm considering last days whether to propose to a girl I like more than others, who I like both in appearance and character ( this is the same one I wrote about a few months ago).
