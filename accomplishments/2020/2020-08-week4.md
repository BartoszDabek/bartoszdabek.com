### Week in Review
I could say it's been a good week and it has been, but one thing is bothering me. On Saturday a friend of mine honestly told me something - something I don't agree with 100% from my perspective. This is something I want to clarify with him. This week (actually at the end of the week) I come to the conclusion that there's no need to put some things into words and be specific. To put it bluntly, you have to be a man and make things clear - especially since I'm no longer a teenager, where you could afford to be stupid. Lesson from this week - be a man.
