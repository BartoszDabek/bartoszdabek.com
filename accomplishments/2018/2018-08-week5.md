### Week in Review
In this week I did huge progress with 'car crash app'. I didn't expect that at all. Another thing is active lifestyle. In one week I made over 100km (bike + running), which is quite good result for me :). From this month I want to start build a bulk and measure that somehow (maybe on github?), but the problem is that I don't really like going to the public gyms. This is something I have to breakthrough.
