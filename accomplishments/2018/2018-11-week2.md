### Week in Review
This week was fine. In work I had (and still have) a lot of work to do with validation framework. I'm actually really happy I have this task because I can learn TDD and in general I'm doing things which are new (never done it before) so it's super cool because I'm learning! And in life - it's ok. In this week I was 3 times on the swimming pool. In general - life is good :)
