### Week in Review
This week was intense. I didn't have a lot of free time. Most of things were in a rush. Honestly? I don't like it! I have to change something so I can have more time to relax, more time for friends, more time for family. This week I've been at two local meetings (1 meeting and 1 conference) - to note: choose wisely where you want to go. Read agenda and then decide because it might be a waste of time :)
