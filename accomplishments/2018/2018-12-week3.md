### Week in Review
This week was very intensive. I had a lot of work (project handover). I also have to write my engineering work until the end of the year. I obligated myself to do it and I hope with God blessing I'll do it. Last but not least I slowly getting up my weight to the limit I established during summer (which is 80 kg until the end of the year). Currently it is 79kg but Christmas comming so... :D
